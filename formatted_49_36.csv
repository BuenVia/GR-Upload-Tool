The power went out once during our seven day stay
TITLE: 
spectacular view and all the comforts of home
REVIEW: 
The steep trip up the mountain in our rented 4x4 was worth it as we found ourselves in a luxurious and comfy home with likely one of the most spectacular views in the area of Ojochal. Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat.

REVIEW: 
We cannot say enough about how wonderfully both the owner and the local property manager handled things during our stay during the recent “atmospheric cyclone” in Northern California. The first night, 1:29 am, to be exact, all power went out in the entire Bodega Bay area due to fallen trees and branches. The owner and manager gave us directions immediately about emergency supplies and we really appreciated the wall-outlet flashlights that lit up immediately when the power failed, We were able to light the gas stove with matches, so we had tea while we enjoyed the storm. The propane fireplace worked, as well, so we were warm and cozy. The next morning, Erika called to see how we were doing and asked the local rep to bring new flashlights and a butane lighter for the stove, The power was out for 22 hours, but we enjoyed every minute. The rest of the week was rainy, and Erika texted us each day to see how we were doing. Beds were comfy, the kitchen perfectly provisioned and the views both peaceful and spectacular, We shall return for retreats as often as possible,

love this house!
REVIEW: 
They did SUCH a great job with this house. It’s so well decorated and READY for guests - you’ll see what I mean when you stay. Everything is labeled with directions and it truly seems like they thought of everything. 

Only issue we had was the power went out and with young kids we were nervous about it getting too cold and their milk/food spoiling. Apparently this is an issue in this area bc we heard the neighbors generator turn on immediately. Unfortunately, the generator for this house was being installed on the Monday after we left, so we didn’t have that luxury, but future renters will have backup. :) We “survived” the power outage just fine as it was restored within a couple hours. 

The kitchen is a bit smaller than it looks in photos. just a heads up that it could get a little tight in there, especially for bigger people. 

Also, the 3rd bedroom is really a loft in the upstairs office and there’s a metal spiral staircase going up. We thought this would be where my 5yo would sleep until we saw the spiral staircase. That made us nervous if he got scared or woke up in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was an air mattress with all the necessary linens that he could use instead. The loft might be ideal for kids, but probably better for older kids (middle school to college-aged, IMO). The ceiling is slanted and I don’t know if you could stand straight up there to be honest. 

All in all, it was a great place to stay. We felt comfortable in the home, it was a great location, and we’d definitely stay here again.

REVIEW: 
Place was awesome view. We will miss it. Just enough space for two. We elected to have joy meet us to show us how to get there. She was big help. The pool is salt and not heated. Was bummed about that. Spacious deck for both sun and shade. We were there for two weeks. Only had one day that electricity went out. Place has back up generator. But when electric goes out whole island so does wifi. So we went to beach that day. If u rent a Jeep from st Thomas and ferry over on car barge. Make sure u get on same company going back. There are more than one. And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves. For Some may be challenging or others fun. Gas / hot deli / grocery store mid way from Cruze bay to coral bay is good. We did a lot of driving around and packed a lunch. We had a great time and would go back. AWESOME VIEW.

TITLE: 
nice view and bedding - poor water/power/wi-fi and rocky beach
REVIEW: 
Some pros and cons:

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean

tropical paradise !
REVIEW: 
We used Nacho for Airport transfer from SJO. We would recommend that for those that have never driven in Costa Rica before. We rented a car from Uvita the next day. The roads are steep and curvy but very passable in dry season. The villa is better than the pictures can capture. We were mostly here to see the jungle and birds, wildlife etc. We were pleased with what all there is to see right from the deck. We had monkeys on the deck rail 2 out of the 7 days! Toucans, Aracaris, Tanagers, Honeycreepers, and many more other species daily. The gardener showed a sloth and its baby to us one day in a tree beside the parking area. So cool! Very friendly and helpful service personnel were there upon our arrival. We had power outages every day, but it was only out for 1 or 2 minutes a day. However, I think a back-up generator was being installed while we were there. We had a problem with the pool but Nacho and Lucie were very quick to remedy that even on a weekend. If you are looking for 1st class location and villa this will not disappoint. We would book this again without hesitation if we have the opportunity. Thank you, Lucie and Cameron, for sharing your piece of paradise with our family.

Yanakie was a very adequate house for our family. All the rooms were spacious with plenty of light. But when the power went out everything went to pot. With no power you have no running water, cannot drink (had to boil before drinking as well) water or use toilets. We lost food in the fridge because the power went out 2 times in 3 nights , 12 hours and 10 hours. The owners were responsive, but the write up did not mention the water business until we got our welcome/keys. Bring your own water if you go to Yanakie. Also, the fuse box is on the front of the house.

Yanakie was a very adequate house for our family. All the rooms were spacious with plenty of light. But when the power went out everything went to pot. With no power you have no running water, cannot drink (had to boil before drinking as well) water or use toilets. We lost food in the fridge because the power went out 2 times in 3 nights , 12 hours and 10 hours. The owners were responsive, but the write up did not mention the water business until we got our welcome/keys. Bring your own water if you go to Yanakie. Also, the fuse box is on the front of the house.

more than the sum of it's parts.
REVIEW: 
The house is so large we ended up using only the second floor. Decorated eclecticly, we were constantly coming across little interesting pieces and flourishes. I won't spoil it for you. One of our favorite spots was a private dining deck open to the bay. We ate most meals there. The private beach access made entering the bay effortless and if you take a short walk along the beach before sunset you can lay on the beach and watch it sink into the Caribbean. If you're a sunrise person the Atlantic beaches are a short distance away. Also our gratitude to Mr and Mrs Williams the caretakers who greeted us on arrival answered our many questions and helped with any issues. They were efficient, friendly and genuinely great people. We had a great time and felt very comfortable. Highly recommend and are planning to return. Another plus is that the house has a generator as do their other properties, so power outages won't infringe on your good time. I could go on, but as others have said it's a very special place. Lastly we would like to thank our hosts Barbara and Luciano for being so caring and helpful. We should have stayed longer.

TITLE: 
nice property when you have electricity & water...
REVIEW: 
My family and I stayed at this property over Christmas. It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain. 

Would I recommend this property? IF the electricity is working, I would rate it a 4. If you stay here, pray that the electricity does not go out!

On the morning of our first night in the home, the power went out. We had no power, heat or hot water. Property Manager was unable to confirm when it would be back on. We went and got food, heat etc until I watched the PGE website and saw the power appeared on in the afternoon. Drove back out to the property and the power was out. Property Manager came by, apologized and said I would be compensated. We left and went back home. I had paid for 3 nights but got one. I was only reimbursed $550 out of the $1400 I paid. I was told by the PM well the power came on at 4pm before the last night. As if we were going to go to a hotel and wait around for the power and pay for 2 locations. PGE website said the power was not coming back on until 10pm our last night so went back home. I have screenshots of the PGE website but the Vacasa LLC will not return my calls, VRBO said they would have them reach out to me but they never did. I have used VRBO for years and NEVER had this issue. This rental is the worst one out there. Be sure to check out all the fees. We paid for a hot tub we couldn't even use. It's ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere! We thought visiting our college town renting a beach house for a birthday celebration would be amazing. It was not.

As much as we enjoyed the location and beach access we would not stay there again unless it has been updated and repairs done.

freezing cold house
REVIEW: 
We have a group of people (10) and we was expecting some livable conditions at the property, where we can relax and warm up after skiing/snowboarding. 
Check in was at 4 pm. However, property was absolutely not ready. It was less than 60 degree inside and it went up to 62 by 9 pm. Management was saying that it’s normal for this house. But, after checking the description of the property, I was able to convince management to save us from freezing. One of the associates was more helpful, she brought some heaters around 10 pm.
Right after she left, electricity went off in a few bedrooms and few bathrooms. Heaters was no option anymore for some people… Management couldn’t help us. After several calls, they was able to offer me “call next day to check on you”. Guess what? Nobody called! Also, they provided info about the breaker for electricity later. 
This is not it. Be ready for cold shower if you have more than 4 people in the house taking shower same day. Boiler is capable to preheat only 5 portions of water for shower. It’s not in the description also btw.
Property wasn’t absolutely clean. Very dusty. They will ask you ti take a trash 10 min from house (DRIVING!!) and they didn’t even provided a code to the gate. 
To summarize: I paid 6k for a house with no heat, hot water, where I have to clean shelves and take care of the trash. Nothing mentioned in the description. Useless management.

TITLE: 
a few issues (some possibly minor and one major)
REVIEW: 
The inside of the property was as pictured. The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be. 

Finally the biggest concern is that the owners tried to charge us several hundred dollars after the fact for deep cleaning based on ""smoking"" inside the house. None of the family are smokers and so this was definitely not the case.

REVIEW: 
The cabin was perfect: easy to get to, easy to park (which is sometimes hard in Munds Park b/c a lot of the driveways are on a hill) and very comfortable. 

This was my kids first time in the snow and boy did they get their fill - we had a huge snowstorm while we were at the cabin. While that was great for snowball fights it made it tough when power went out in the whole community. Travis and Heather were GREAT in helping get me out - the snowplow had created a huge wall of ice that they helped dig me out of and got me on the road safely.

Definitely plan to rent the cabin again - just hopefully not with 4 feet of snow next time. 

Highly recommended!!!

perfect stay in paradise
REVIEW: 
If you’re looking for a perfect place to stay with great oceanfront views every day all day and be amongst great people in the Bahamians this is the place. There are no crowds to deal with just you, the locals and your own schedule. Cecil’s place is amazing. We like to vacation at our own pace while having the views we’ve come to love being at oceanfront. We don’t like the crowds and the tourism side of things so this was perfect for us. 
If you consider staying here read the amenities abs details more than once. This is not a fully laid out Airbnb but it is perfect if you’re looking to vacation at a wonderful place. 
We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcoholic or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage.

My family has been renting houses for our annual winter trip for many years. This home is the nicest and most well equipped that we have ever stayed in. 
It was sparkling clean and the beds were comfortable. There were plenty of linens, blankets, towels, etc… The host provided coffee and a bottle of wine and there was a spice cabinet with the basics. We did some cooking and everything that we needed was there. 
I especially enjoyed the covered deck downstairs. I was able to sit on a comfortable outdoor couch in front of a fire pit and watch my grandchildren play in the snow. 
PG&E had a power outage shortly after we arrived. When i message the owner he responded immediately and offered to drive up and start the generator for us. He also drove up 2 days before our stay to make sure the driveway and stairs were clear of snow. 
Little touches like bed trays set up ion each master bed made me feel like a special guest. I would definitely stay again.

It's I the bottom floor and 2nd door down from the main entrance so everytime someone walked in and out the metal door would bang. Unfortunately people had been smoking in the apartment so everything stank of smoke towels the lot! It's a shame as the owners are lovely 🙁

REVIEW: 
Check-in information was sent a month ahead of my stay. This made the check-in process a little clunky as this information was not provided closer to my stay and got overlooked. A quick call to Charlotte though and we were able to receive our check-in information on the phone. 

The condo is located right off the Corridor run. A little bit of a push to get yourself to the Gondola but easy to get to when ending for the day. 

A couple of days before our stay was over, the lighting fixtures above the dining area and kitchen went out. Charlotte was quick to respond when messaging her early in the morning and said she would get someone there soon. I wish communication was better here as while a maintenance guy was sent over to repair the light fixture, he ended up leaving me with no power at all. I had to communicate with Charlotte to get power back after the maintenance guy left for over an hr. Power was restored by the end of the day but the light fixture was not replaced with a dimmer switch but a regular flip switch. The fixtures are very bright without the dimmer in place but I was happy to have power and my stay was almost over.

difficult isolated stay
REVIEW: 
I don't even know where to start. I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

My wife and I booked this place for our honeymoon as it looked extremely promising. When we arrived the place was dirty, hair all over the couch/food stains and sticky counter tops. The master bathroom smelled like sewage. We contacted mauricio and asked him if our suite had even been cleaned before our arrival and this is just the beginning. I tried to contact the host before our arrival for the check in process and he literally didn’t answer back until 20 mins before check in. On day three the power went out, there was no electricity running water or working toilets, I know it’s out of their control but he did absolutely nothing to help us figure out what to do in this situation. It was 120 degrees in the apartment and stuffy and dark and the security gate no longer worked. We ended up packing our stuff and walking to the hotel in town in the dark. Day two no power and still no help from Mauricio. At that point we went back packed all of our stuff and left for good. The first two days my wife had really bad allergies and we couldn’t figure out why until Mauricio sent me pictures of the couch and accused us of bringing a dog even though I had messaged him immediately when we got there and questioned if they had even cleaned the place, given her allergies we tried to stay out of the Vrbo as much as possible since it seemed like that’s the only place they were triggered. My wife is deathly allergic to dogs and there was dog hair all over the couch behind the pillows. Good luck getting a refund from these people or Vrbo. Our honeymoon was ruined and was also slightly dangerous given we had to figure out what to do walking around in the dark in a cartel ridden town no thanks to Mauricio. STAY AWAY FROM VRBO AND ARBA.

Stay away. Booked this for a ski trip with family. Drove from Seattle only to find there was no place to park due to snow, property had no electricity. It was unsafe to stay with kids overnight. Couldn't contact property manager multiple calls going to vm which was full so couldnt leave message. We turned back after trying for an hr. Host finally messaged he will refund but still havent gotten the money back in 1 month. I am out almost $1000. Vrbo customer service is non existent too. Left a complaint with no response yet. The property is a metal container that has been converted. There is no bathroom to wash, only a very dirty porta potty! The listing is inaccurate. Stay away!! Will give negative 5 stars. Waste of money. I plan to stay away from VRBO. We book cabins every few months - this has been the worst experience in years.

This is a great property and located just minutes from the Ski hill. The hot tub with a view after skiing is Awesome. The duel floors allow two couples (or couple with kids )to enjoy the place and still have privacy. The owners are very responsive to questions and issues. The garage is very tiny but my Jeep Latitude just fit. Warning! The garage can only be opened from key pad on outside of garage. If power goes out you cannot gain access to the garage or contents until power is restored. Learned that the hard way. I recommend leaving it open just enough to crawl under to manually open if you have a big ski day planned. The kitchen has all the equipment you need to cook your meals and a table for four. TV has great streaming options. The floor heat is very nice and fans are provided for. those who like white noise or a little breeze. Overall a Great place to stay!

TITLE: 
appealing apartment, the images are very deceiving.
REVIEW: 
This was quite simply the worst place we have ever stayed! we would not recommend it to anyone. It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone.

We returned the 2nd night to find there was a power issue (unrelated to house). Our hosts immediately came out to the property and made sure we were taken care of. All was resolved quickly by the power company. 

They were wonderful hosts and we would love to return again if the house is available. Thank you!

REVIEW: 
Linda was great! She was very communicative. She contacted us a few days in advance to provide check-in information and answer any questions we had. She also provided suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We got unlucky with the weather while we were there and were under a weather alert at one point with predicted power outages and Linda dropped off a flashlight and battery-powered lantern for us just in case. She made us feel very welcome and taken care of the entire time. 

The property itself was also very nice. It's a studio in the lower level of a little bungalow, but felt spacious and was comfortably arranged. The bathroom was a nice size (bigger than I expected) and the kitchenette was well-stocked for what we needed. We dined out a lot, but there were plates, silverware, mini fridge, microwave, and toaster oven for leftovers (plus more equipment that we didn't use). 

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property. There were lots of coffee and restaurant options within 15 minutes' driving distance (many within 5 minutes), it was 20-30 minutes to the sites we wanted to see in San Francisco, and 60-90 minutes to nature areas like Muir Woods and Point Reyes. 

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable. 

This property was nice and cozy and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Linda!

If you’re looking for a perfect place to stay with great oceanfront views every day all day and be amongst great people in the Bahamians this is the place. There are no crowds to deal with just you, the locals and your own schedule. This cottage is amazing. We like to vacation at our own pace while having the views we’ve come to love being at oceanfront. We don’t like the crowds and the tourism side of things so this is perfect if that’s what you enjoy. 
We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. There is a store about 15 minutes south on your left that is well stocked. Prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians owner is a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcohol or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage.

Sad to say this because the property is awesome, but completely unusable during the winter. The property manager did not have the driveway cleared. We shoveled it ourselves. There was no salt. 4x4 truck not keep cold get up it. Pure ice. Manager did not reply. Power went out on day 2 of stay and we left due to no heat. Charged for all 3 days.

Still no reply.

Day two we shoveled again and had to shovel the road way as well. Yes we had chains. Beautiful place, perfect for a ski weekend, if you have a snowmobile… otherwise don’t bother at all.

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stay in a rental property. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

REVIEW: 
Hi Alice, I’m providing some feedback as requested. While it’s much appreciated that accommodation like the Raetihi bach is available at low cost, and a more basic standard is expected for the price, there were a few issues. The bach was quite dirty when we arrived. We’ve left it cleaner than when we arrived, but providing some cleaning products (cloths, toilet cleaner, gloves, etc) would help future people with this. More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous. In short, we think the bach needs a check and a good clean before the next people come in.

The townhome was absolutely beautiful and exactly as described and shown in the pictures. It was the perfect location in the city and easy to get to. Beds were very comfortable. Home was well stocked with supplies and necessities except for one oversight of not having kitchen trash bags. Communication with the property manager was great.

The home is very large so there were a few areas that was overlooked when it came to cleaning and maintenance. The previous guest left a used sanitary napkin in the master closet. The towels in one of the guest rooms were still a bit damp like they just were not left in the dryer long enough.

REVIEW: 
The owner was nice enough to allow us to checkin early & out later, however upon checkin there were issues that we brought to his attention that were not addressed. #1 Fire Alarm was removed from the wall and Beeping/Chirping when we put it back in. We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice. Overall at almost $300 for one night, I’d never stay at this unit again.

Really enjoyed the condo. Perfect for 2 adults. Any more would be a bit tight given the limited amount of closet space and how small the bedrooms are. My only major criticism is that for a 2 week stay it would have been nice to offer a full cleaning / laundry / sheet change at the end of one week....that would have happened in any case had I rented 2 x one week so not sure why it was not offered. 
The garage was just big enough for a standard SUV and that was a good thing as there are generally NOT enough ""visitor"" parking spots when you need them (at night).

Cleanliness of the condo was definitely not the best, stuff from previous ""renters"" were still in the rooms. Lost internet for most of the stay which sucked but not much you can do about that. Smoke alarm started to beep do to low battery in the middle of the night. Very minimum things in there. Normally there is trash bags, ziploc bags, foil, salt and pepper, sugar, coffee not at this place. It literally has bare minimum in there.

Beautiful and large condo with a gorgeous location right on the beach. It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.
3. This is very minor but, we could not get the toaster to work no matter how we tried

We enjoyed our stay here, it was a great location with close walk to the shops and not far to the beach. Excellent space for a family of 5. House was really clean and tidy, really well looked after (even if it looks a bit dated in parts in the photos - yes it is, but it’s fine and in really good condition). Beds, linen, pillows all fantastic, great condition and very comfortable. Pool table was fun and three TVs were great. Internet perfect. Smoke alarms went off once for no reason and another time just opening the oven. Not a big deal. Slight leak in kitchen skylight in heavy rain was a bit of pain but didn’t cause a significant problem. Would definitely stay here again. Best improvement to make would be a nice outdoor area to sit and relax outside, not particularly inviting and so we didn’t hang out the back at all. Again, not a big issue but would’ve made it that much better. Thanks for providing a nice place.

My stay was ok, but there were several things that could have been done better. Dollar store TP and paper towels gotta go. I had to purchase my own. None of the remotes worked, had to buy batteries. Smoke detector was beeping, had to replace a 9V battery there. 

Bed was horrible, I barely slept. And the HVAC system was so loud that if I did fall asleep, it wouldn't last long. Remote work was uncomfortable because my only option was the kitchen table with non optimal chair. 

Listing said there was a fitness center. I never found it. There was a bike parked outside, I assumed it was for the property, but it had two flat tires and a rusted chain so that wasn't going to do any good.

The location was quiet and other than the upstairs neighbor having an occasional wrestling match with his dog (I'm guessing) the noise and traffic in the complex was acceptable.

For my next visit to Mesquite I will look elsewhere.

I'll start with positives. The beds were so comfortable; we slept so well! Location was great and easy to access. Plenty of space for sleeping , easily sleeps 10. Xbox was a hit with the kids. Hot tub was nice. 
Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out. Ping pong table net is hanging on by a thread, and one of the fooz ball players is broken. Lastly, the advertising was slightly misleading as we thought this was a house. It is a duplex, connected with one other building. Not a huge problem, but we prefer a detached home when it's advertised as a house.
Overall, a nice stay.

REVIEW: 
Spend your money on a different rental for your ski weekend. During our first night were awaken by smoke detectors blaring throughout the house, and after inspecting we realized there was no threat or reason for the alarms to be going off. We were unable to disarm the alarms, and attempted several times to get in contact with Randy (for over an hour) with no response. We ended up needing to call 911 and have the fire department show up to disarm. Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub. You can definitely find a more comfortable stay elsewhere with better management. Save yourself the headache of booking here.

the perfect spot for a family getaway!
REVIEW: 
The location of Jays cabin home is an A+++

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :). We were so appreciative. 

Thank you Jay & his concierge, for offering this wonderful lake home. We can’t wait to come back. 

P. S. The wifi is great!

absolute rip off!!!
REVIEW: 
So this place is NOTHING but a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! They charge you $35 DAILY ""resort fee"" which all that inlcudes is access to a rooftop pool that closes at sundown!! Then they charge you $40 DAILY parking fee!! Ontop of these fees if you want housekeeping to clean your room then that's ANOTHER $80 DAILY fee!! This listing & owner is UNETHICAL by charging ALL of these EXTRA fees!! You might think that you're getting a deal at $135 night for a ""beach front"" condo which by the way isnt even ""beach front"" its several miles away from the beach. Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!! You're better off renting a room at the Hilton or Marriot for $250-$275 at least that includes: housekeeping, parking, breakfast, clean towels, toliet paper, pools that dont close until 11pm, etc. The place was dirty too!! The first night I checked in I found feces on my bathroom towels!! Yes HUMAN POOP!!! There was also mold on the towels & on walls in the bathroom!! The floors were so dirty that they turned my feet BLACK!! If I can post pics I will!! The appliances are so difficult to work & understand because they're targeted to foreigners!! The stove & diahwasher just has symbols & knobs goodluck trying to figure out how to use them with NO instructions!! Three days into my stay the fire alarm goes off in the building awakening me out of a deep sleep that almost gave me a heart attack!! Everyone was forced to evaluate the whole building for almost 1hr!! This is what I paid $275 a night for? Day# 5 into my stay I'm sleeping & hear someone trying to enter my room mid morning? Luckily, I had the deadbolt locked & the extra lock mechanism. I most certainly heard several beeps coming from the door as if someone was trying to ENTER my room while I was sleeping!! Talk about SHADY ASF!! Day #6 into my stay I receive a knock at the front door around noon. I'm a professional poker player so I'm out playing poker tournaments until 6am in the morning I just got back to the room & finally fell asleep around 7am-8am. I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""? What a crock of BS if I've EVER heard!! You're better off finding a 4 star hotel & paying $250-$300 a night to be treated way better & NOT have to deal with a bunch of shady Mexicans trying to enter your room!!

i wanted to love this place
REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stays in an Airbnb or VBRO. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

The alarms went off all night and when we checked out that morning they were STILL going off. I reached out to who we rented the condo from to see if they could compensate us for our awful last night at their condo. After a week of back and forth, they said no, because we didn't call them directly. We called the non-emergency # listed in the condo instead. I wouldn't stay again because of how our complaint was handled after the fact.

TITLE: 
unfortunately not what we had hoped...
REVIEW: 
I was very disappointed with our experience at this property. We stay at many VRBO's and this property was one of our worst. The issues were all communicated to the management company upon checkout and to this day, almost a month later, we have not received any type of resolution. 
 
Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard. The communication was subpar both locally and from Evolve. Very disappointing!

REVIEW: 
Always a great stay, however, it does need a few updates. Two years in a row the heat was an issue. The manager/owner fixed it, but, it was something we had to deal with. One side of the stove is not working and the other side worked half the time. Hard to bake if the oven won't stay on and the kitchen is part of the reason we stay at this house. The kitchen needs a good cleaning. With a professional stove you deal with a lot of grease and the area around the stove and the vent area needs attention. We had to fix a few chairs that had loose legs when we got there and one of the chairs at the dining room table is broken. The grill on the back porch also needs a good cleaning. When grilling or smoking it ends up firing up because of all the old grease left on it and it has a few broken parts. The last thing is the wood burning fire place, the chimney probably needs a clean out. When starting a fire you end up with a lot of smoke in the house until the fire gets really hot.

REVIEW: 
We rent several times a year at various properties. In recent years you can start to feel the ""blah"" of corporate or large rental groups that is reflected in their properties. It was nice to stay at a home not just a house this time, it had thought-out amenities that make a home, it had things you didn't know you needed, until you needed them. It is risky, costly and I imagine a pain to maintain these offerings, we should all be thankful and respectful because these properties and hospitality are becoming rare. I was surprised and a little confused when the actual home owner reached out to me, an actual person, not a generated text or rental service employee. He spoke like we were old friends, which was the confusing part at first but once that was sorted out we had a great introductory conversation. Fire wood, toys, games and knives that actually cut, snow was scarce and ice was unsafe but all the extras were enough to accommodate and entertain all age groups. Thank you again -RJS

Not so good - the wonderful view was blocked by vehicles parked out front, the double bed was quite uncomfortable, some TLC is needed in the property with fittings (broken and uncovered light sockets/exposed wiring) and some items fell/broke due to poor attachments to plaster (owner repaired when contacted). Couldn't see a fire alarm and the oven kept tripping the fuse box/power off when used. The owner was easy to contact on Stayz and while not living nearby, had a neighbour who was available if needed. Instructions for the use of the appliances would have been helpful, also some fishing rods or beach gear that we might borrow. Was overpriced for a shack but overall a fairly pleasant stay.

REVIEW: 
The owner was nice enough to allow us to checkin early & out later, however upon checkin there were issues that we brought to his attention that were not addressed. #1 Fire Alarm was removed from the wall and Beeping/Chirping when we put it back in. We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice. At almost three Benjamins for one night, I’d keep looking for a better spot.

REVIEW: 
This property is about 10 minutes to the beach which is very convenient. The condo itself is dingy, dirty, and very outdated. The walls are scuffed up, outlets are starting to become a fire hazard, and there was hair in the tub from previous renters.

our stay
REVIEW: 
Door was jammed when we first arrived. Had to try for at least 20 minutes before we got in the house. Luckily, the host answered relatively fast. The fire alarm was almost out of batteries as it beeped occasionally, which isn’t very safe. The steps going into the basement were extremely steep, we had a few minor accidents. Living room was spacious and clean. The bedrooms were nice too. Before booking we asked the host if the hot tub was accessible and they said yes, it was not. No water and not ready to be used. We tried filling it up the next morning with the help of one of the neighbors, he told us there might be a leak since water wouldn’t stay. Our overall stay was okay, just some minor house issues that they should maybe look into.

a holiday home with potential (with more attention to maintenance).
REVIEW: 
We recently rented this property for a family of 7. While the property itself has many good features, presents nicely and the property managers responded quickly to problems as they arose, we were confronted with a number of concerning issues which we spent valuable holiday time dealing with quite apart from the total inconvenience of the maintenance failures eg the dishwasher failed on the first usage & leaked into the downstairs (dishwasher hose & associated electrics- rodent damage), 3 beds at least did not have fresh sheets and had sand etc in them (too late at night to involve property managers), batteries to 2 fans needed replacing and fire alarm battery needed replacing after dishwasher leak. The one upstairs toilet had a very unpleasant & obvious smell. The downstairs ensuite accommodation (a room off the converted garage) does not have an opening window in the bedroom or a fan, the nearby kitchenette could at least provided glasses for water- it is totally empty of any utensils. Not really a pleasant alternative space for grandparents!

sauna rip-off
REVIEW: 
We are a couple that stayed 2 weeks and we found the kitchen hob to be really old and dangerous to use. Sometimes the smoke alarm went off for no reason and we noticed this thanks to the webcam that we left inside the apartment and this has caused us problems a few times. The apartment price included the sauna, but unfortunately upon our arrival we found a paper notice on the door saying that it’s out of use for the whole stay and we haven’t received any compensation.

a comfortable beach house and place to escape and chill
REVIEW: 
It's a classic beach house - light, airy, casual & comfortable with minor imperfections that don't get in the way of having a great time. It is clearly used regularly based on the inventory of conveniences like condiments. There was a plentiful supply of wood for the fire which we enjoyed. We also enjoyed the Jacuzzi on cool mornings and evenings. We cooked a 6-course BD dinner for 8 in a well-equipped kitchen. Given that the enclave is locked, we felt safe and secure. The beach is close enough for a short sunrise viewing, short dog walks and longer stays for beachcombing. The one surprise we need to mention is that a dog can escape the property from the back yard though not from the front yard. He only escaped once and all was well. We had a great time!

just okay
REVIEW: 
Property is well located in Greenway Plaza area on Richmond. But it is a large apartment bldg. So there are many access points. It’s cumbersome to use the app while trying to bring items in and figuring out which entrance to use. A detailed map with preferred parking area would be useful. Entrance D on 3rd floor looked to be most manageable with available spots. 

The unit itself was ok but in need of maintenance. The smoke detector was chirping when we arrived but was tended to before nightfall. But primary bath was not very clean. Hair and dirty cotton balls were on the floor. Caulking around tub was gross. Secondary bathtub was peeling and did not drain properly. Kitchen needed additional trash bags. Linens for beds and towels were all thin and not high quality. Could be a really great rental with some TLC.

REVIEW: 
The house itself was really nice. Lots of open living area. Not well stcked with pots and pans. Broken handles and burnt pans. No crock pot and the mirco wave was unusable. Rusted and burnt inside. We kept it unplug due to the fire hazard. Also left main bedroom, the floor was sunken. Worried that the under floor had dry rot. Only cool water in the main bathroom for showers. If upgrades were made, it would be a great house and would rent it again.

TITLE: 
you get what you pay for
REVIEW: 
First, this property is NOT a resort as listed. It is a nice gated community that is pretty quiet (we had one problem neighbor who wanted to stand outside and talk loud under the master bedroom window until about midnight) with a great resort-style pool. The condo itself was clean, but tired. It really needs much TLC. The sofa was hard to sit on, the cushions just sink into the frame as it is a pull out. Also, the owner was very nice and responsive, but cannot say the same for her property management company. We had a problem with a smoke alarm going off randomly and she had to resort to calling the HOA President, Andy, who came over on a Friday night to change the batteries in all the alarms. Evergreen, the Property Mgmt Co was supposed to have come over the day before, but didn't return phone calls on Friday when the problem persisted. Again, you get what you pay for so this isn't a complaint, just so anyone in the future will know before you go!
