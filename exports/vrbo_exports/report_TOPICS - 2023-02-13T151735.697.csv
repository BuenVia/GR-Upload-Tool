View was beautiful from the dining and living room, as well as the kitchen. The rest of the house furniture wise was a little dated but comfortable. This house is about a 2 minute drive to the ski lodge at appalachian ski mountain where our children were taking ski lessons this weekend. 

Our main issue for the house was its exterior condition. This house is located close to the top of the Appalachian mountain Ski resort which is often blowing snow, and some of that snow may blow back on the property. In addition, it had snowed a few days prior. When we arrived, the driveway was not plowed, and with the temps jumping above and below 32 degrees it quickly became very slick. We could not pull one of our cars out of the driveway as a result, and the walkway to the entrance was also covered in snow and became pretty slick (one of our members slipped on the way in). The next day one of us had to shovel and salt the driveway ourself to give a chance for our subaru to make it out. 

On top of this, the thermostat was set to 50 degrees when we arrived, and took overnight to warm up the whole house to 70. We had to keep our 2, 4, and 6 year old in their jackets the rest of the evening to keep them warm. My father in law also tried calling the number provided for the owner but never received a call back. 

When I contacted the owner via the vrbo app they indicated that it is hard to keep up with the snow at all times, and so the driveway and walkway may not be cleaned. They also said that they control the heat remotely via wifi so that perhaps there was a connection issue. 

Regardless, for folks who are making decisions in the future on where to stay, just note that these may be things that you might have to deal with after arrival during the winter season. Had we known that we would have to clean the driveway, we would have saved the expense and just stayed in a hotel."

Sometimes photos make a home look better than it is, this absolutely isn’t the case with Southern Pines (it’s even better in person!)
Other than the fact it’s beautifully decorated, open the cabinets and you’ll find all of the amenities of home (and probably more) sippy cups for toddlers, bath toys, plush robes, and every kitchen item one might need. We sat in the hot tub on the gorgeous deck as snow fell around us and planned our trip back in the summer when we know we’ll be able to hear the Blue River flowing just below us. My only complaint is that any other home rental we’ve booked since staying at Southern pines is just a let down. Once you stay at a home that is fully stocked, with comfortable beds, and beautiful decor- everything else just falls short."

Right across the street from John’s Pass, and right on the beach. Pool was very nice and can’t beat the view. Washer and dryer on site was nice. Size of the unit was great and liked the layout. 

Cons: This particular unit needs a lot of attention in my opinion. Cabinet door knobs were sticky and grimy, baseboards were filthy, beds were super worn in and uncomfortable, showers had mold in the caulk, and the entire unit smelled of must. There was even some mold around the ceiling vents. The carpeting was stained and worn down. Cosmetically it was outdated…. Furniture was mismatched and didn’t fit the space well. 

One evening when I was getting into bed, I even noticed blood stains on the pillow (not on the pillow case, but on the pillow itself). To be clear, these did not come from me. When I went to swap it out for an extra that was in the closet, all of those were full of stains and what appeared to be mold. 

This unit “got the job done” in terms of a good location and a roof over our heads, but definitely did not meet my expectations of basic cleanliness. Won’t be staying again."

Very nice the house was stocked with trash bags and paper towel as this can be rare with rentals.
While the washer and dryer happened to be on the fritz, the host was great with communication and helping give solutions to have any clothes washed/dried while we were there.

The kitchen is well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The mud /ski room makes getting in and out of gear easy albeit it could use a few more spots for skis. The rooms are all a nice size and the tv room is a great space and doesn’t impact the other lounge area (no noise).

The property is about 1km walk from the village which was a nice stroll and not i convenient. The ski in was easy and ended about 50m from the property whilst the walk to put skis on is about 350m slightly uphill. The walk was simple enough.

All in all we really enjoyed the property and found it great value. 

We note previous reviews mentioned the tenant and I would say the current tenant is great! He helped when we got a car stuck after snow fall (driver error - not me) and if you didn’t see his car you wouldn’t have known he was there.

The owner was great really communicated well and when their was an issue with the spa had it fixed quickly."

Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen."

It was minutes away from everything we needed to do and only 30 mins from the quarter. But we chose this location so all the kids could enjoy being outside and away from the winter weather. The door to the back door was locked, one of the access points had a stump so we couldn't get in the back and the other gate was blocked. I messaged the owner and asked if we could use the back since there was nothing barring us from using it in the listing. We had to lift kids over and climb over to use the back yard. We moved the camera so it still pointed at the street but wasn't on the kids playing and the owner messaged us asking us to put it back. We were so uncomfortable we didn't let the kids go back outside. Truly made us feel like criminals Garage had a huge hole in the roof. Nothing provided to cook with other than pots, no spatulas cooking sheetc ECT,. The outlets in most of the house didn't work. There were sparks coming from the ones in the master bed and the only outlet that did work in there was falling out of the wall. Jets in the tub in the master bath didn't work. In the other bathroom the outlets didn't work, both tubsand stand up shower didn't drain, had standing water, and had black gunk coming from the drains and one of the overhead lights/fans didn't work. Heat settings were at 64° block so we were all freezing. Broken glass littered the flower pots. Laundry room was locked off from being used (we had babies with us). We had to buy our own cleaning products because the owner said there was some but we couldn't find it."

You are paying for location, not quality of accommodations. Of note, this is unit #9 in the condo block. This is not listed in the check-in details and you will be left wandering around peering in windows trying to find the art that matches the listing photos until the manager calls you back. The only hint we got that we were in unit 9 was the name of the wifi network. 

There were three main issues with this property. 
1. The garage door was broken and we had to manage a service call while we were there (they fixed it in a haphazard way that required a light switch to be on in order to operate the door)
2. The dryer was broken. We were instructed that the dry mountain air is great for hang-drying. Fine, but for a week and 6 people we just had laundry hanging everywhere the entire time.  3. The management company said they had a cable person coming for a routine service, but asked us if we’d like to decline the visit. We said we’d like to decline and went on with our ski day. Later in the day I find out my mom was in the bathroom when a stranger let themselves into the house. After being super freaked out she learns it is the cable person. When pressed, the person said they used the code and let themselves in. In our opinion this was unacceptable and raises safety and security concerns. When we asked the management company to respond, they stopped responding to my messages and didn’t contact us again until they sent an automated check out message.

We’re reasonable renters and don’t expect perfection. We understand issues arise when you are staying in someone else’s home, but the combination of these three things (given the price of the rental) just amounted to too many problems and I was really disappointed that the management company ghosted us when I asked for a response. 

Pros:
3 minute walk to the poma t-bar. Location is excellent
Large mudroom where you can leave your skis and poles
Spacious bedrooms each with their own bathroom
Apple TV makes casting/music easy

Cons: 
Broken drier
Broken garage door
Unplowed driveway (they didn’t plow after a few snows and now it is just a compacted snow mess that is really challenging to drive over and treacherous to walk on)
Mildewy dish towels
Pots that leak (literally leak, we were boiling water and realized it was slowly seeping out the bottom)

- Die Bilder der Wohnung entsprechen nicht mehr ganz der Realität. Es hat nur noch 1 Etagenbett, dafür noch ein Kinderbett und eine Treppe in den oberen Stock, wo noch 2
Betten vorhanden sind. Die Treppe ist für Kleinkinder gefährlich, da sie zwischen den Stufen hindurchkrabbeln können (entspricht nicht den Bauvorschriften!!!)
- Im Grossen und Ganzen eine tolle Wohnung, welche noch mehr Potenzial hätte."

Only thing about this property, it had black mold in the vents and on the ceiling in the living room. A quick spray with some bleach solution would take care of this. I would rent here again."

Really doesn't sleep as many as the website claims comfortably. We were going for a memorial service and I stated as much in the initial VRBO correspondence....but kept getting ""Enjoy your Vacation!"" emails. Email from property manager stated we need parking passes then I was told we didn't need parking passes at the office? I wanted a place where the family could gather and mourn without having to worry about insignificant things....however the tone set by the property manager's automatic emails and materials made everyone feel unwelcome and uneasy. In the beginning of the process, I chatted with a VRBO tech about the ridiculous contract and she was no help."
