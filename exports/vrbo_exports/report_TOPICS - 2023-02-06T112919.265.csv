Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat."

There are not a lot of stores or restaurants open but it is wonderful to be at the seashore at that time of year. However, winter in Maine can be tricky. We experienced a snow/ice storm which resulted in an area-wide power outage. The house has a Generac backup generator which did not turn on when the power went off. We contacted Olivia who immediately contacted an electrician and boiler repairman. We felt lucky that these very busy tradesmen were able to come over soon and remedy the problem, particularly since much of the area remained out of power for up to several days. Putting that experience behind us, we enjoyed a very peaceful stay and are grateful to Olivia for her prompt efforts to help us. We would not hesitate to stay here again."

We would recommend that for those that have never driven in Costa Rica before. We rented a car from Uvita the next day. The roads are steep and curvy but very passable in dry season. The villa is better than the pictures can capture. We were mostly here to see the jungle and birds, wildlife etc. We were pleased with what all there is to see right from the deck. We had monkeys on the deck rail 2 out of the 7 days! Toucans, Aracaris, Tanagers, Honeycreepers, and many more other species daily. The gardener showed a sloth and its baby to us one day in a tree beside the parking area. So cool! Very friendly and helpful service personnel were there upon our arrival. We had power outages every day, but it was only out for 1 or 2 minutes a day. However, I think a back-up generator was being installed while we were there. We had a problem with the pool but Nacho and Lucie were very quick to remedy that even on a weekend. If you are looking for 1st class location and villa this will not disappoint. We would book this again without hesitation if we have the opportunity. Thank you, Lucie and Cameron, for sharing your piece of paradise with our family."

The first night, 1:29 am, to be exact, all power went out in the entire Bodega Bay area due to fallen trees and branches. The owner and manager gave us directions immediately about emergency supplies and we really appreciated the wall-outlet flashlights that lit up immediately when the power failed, We were able to light the gas stove with matches, so we had tea while we enjoyed the storm. The propane fireplace worked, as well, so we were warm and cozy. The next morning, Erika called to see how we were doing and asked the local rep to bring new flashlights and a butane lighter for the stove, The power was out for 22 hours, but we enjoyed every minute. The rest of the week was rainy, and Erika texted us each day to see how we were doing. Beds were comfy, the kitchen perfectly provisioned and the views both peaceful and spectacular, We shall return for retreats as often as possible,"

The building is old so these are two very noisy clunky elevators. I bought ear plugs to ""survive"" my 5 night stay. The power for the TV, Internet, and Fridge all went out on my 4th day. Turns out that the breaker panel is in the hallway - I ended up resetting the breakers myself - but it's crazy to have a breaker panel that any tenant could meddle with in an open hallway. On my last day there I was given a new code to open the main entrance door to the building. The explanation to use the new code was totally inadequate - I ended up standing out in the cold for 10 minutes at 12:45 am while trying to figure out how to get into the building. I ended up having to WAKE UP the superintendent to get into the building. Not a happy experience. The unit had a nice clean bathroom, the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had ""barely adequate utensils which were all very old and very well used. I would not trust Tanor to rent me any of his other units - this was overall a very annoying and unsatisfactory experience."

Property manager was very responsive and helped us work through everything. I cannot express enough how great the property manager was!
Beds were very comfortable, but there was only one thick/firm style of pillow that will not work for stomach sleepers.
Pool or ocean are both a 5 minute walk away. And you are in walking distance to a few different restaurants. Twisted Lime was my personal fave. Just make sure you aren't starving before you get to the restaurant as service is quite a bit slower than we are used to in Canada. 
NOTE: Bon Vivants cafe and cocktail bar is directly below the primary bedroom. If you are an early to bed person, this would be an issue due to the late-night noise. However, we didnt understand hurricane doors - you have to pull the handle up to make the door shut properly. We didn't figure this out until midstay, which lessened the noise.
We went with our two children, 10 and 12, and felt quite safe. 
You can take the #10 bus to downtown Nassau. Route goes along the coast and is about a 20 minute ride. Bus can be caught anywhere on the side of the main road by flagging them down. And when you want to get off, just say ""bus stop"". Fare is $1.50 per person. NOTE: Do NOT take the #10A is this route winds inland and takes significantly longer. Cabs were more expensive than we were expecting, and they charge additional for more than two people ($50 to downtown one way for 5 people).
Overall, a really great place to stay, but everything was significantly more expensive than we were expecting in the Bahamas."

This was very disappointing and frustrating given that I had been traveling and working all day and was exhausted by the time I got to the unit and then had to sit on the phone for several hours with VRBO reps trying to get the mess sorted out. On top of all that, the power went out the next evening while I was trying to get ready for a dinner party and had to use the flashlight on my cell phone in order to shower and get dressed, which was quite difficult.

The property description proclaimed there were lounge chairs on the balcony overlooking the sea, when in actuality there were 4 plastic, hard, upright chairs that were not at all conducive to relaxation & a half-broken wooden table to place your drink on! We would have liked to spend more time on the balcony, but the chairs were too uncomfortable. The balcony handrails were all rusted and needed repair, while the neighboring condo rails were in great shape. We were allowed in early to enjoy the pool/beach, as the cleaning lady knew she had to work well after 5PM to make it right for us from the mess left behind from the previous renter. She was super! There were dirty dishes left in the dishwasher undone, & a frying pan with food still attached was found in the oven. We had to clean all the utensils, pots, & dishes that we wanted to use before we could use them. There was minimal TV service, & were told upon check-in that we would have to have our own subscription to Hulu, or Netflix etc, which we don""t subscribe to. This needs to be addressed in the description of the property for those without subscriptions, as internet service was our only access to outside news - when it was working. The screen on the bedroom sliding glass door to the balcony was trashed, so we could not open it for the lovely breeze that is available in the evening & also for air when the power went out!- which may have been a blessing since there were 2 stray cats that took up residence on our 1st floor balcony during the night. The master bath shower area is cave-like & really needed a power vent to remove the moisture, but that was broken. The stove top is barely working, as the touch pad is so worn it is difficult to adjust the temperature & to turn on & off. The paint on the ceiling is peeling off in the common kitchen area, & the refrigerator water/ice machine with the filter is inop so no potable water. The condo has the absolute BEST location in the entire complex with direct access to the pools & the beach is just steps away. Good parking is available close to the front door & is by gated access only with guard 24/7. This poor condo needs some TLC and it would be absolutely awesome!! We enjoyed St Maarten and this building location gives easy driving access to both the French & Dutch side restaurants, and the airport, while providing a very peaceful & restful atmosphere. Just needs a little TLC!"

It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain. 

Would I recommend this property? IF the electricity is working, I would rate it a 4. If you stay here, pray that the electricity does not go out!"

And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves.

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean"

There was not any shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, extra garbage bags (only 1 provided) nor directions where to put trash. There were hairs in the bedsheets. Host never emailed the wifi info beforehand as the platform clearly said should have been done, and we only get it several hours later after asking. 

On check out, host told me to message her directly on WhatsApp to reserve instead of the platform, a clear violation of VRBO’s rules and regulations. She then bombarded us with unwanted messages and solicitations afterwards. 

She also told us the 2 people before us mentioned they also had no direction where to put any trash either. And that they take care of it and laundry, when I told her we washed towels. Clean ones were in the dryer and ones that need to be washed were in the washer. This did not need to be done by us, but was done anyways.

There was also a non disclosed video camera recording the unit which is also another huge violation of VRBO’s policies.

Inside home was nice, with a nice garden, however no view of the pool as listed in the description. 
 
TV in extra bedroom did not work properly, and cut out every 10 seconds to a black screen for 10 seconds.

The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be. 

Finally the biggest concern is that the owners tried to charge us several hundred dollars after the fact for deep cleaning based on ""smoking"" inside the house. None of the family are smokers and so this was definitely not the case."

- I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room (all over sofa). I immediately contacted owner who lives close by but instead of coming over to look, she instructed me to put pots out to collect dripping water and that a roofer would come by Monday. Monday it was fixed but she left the dirty leak collecting pots in the sink for me to clean myself. Had I been the owner, I would have left a bottle of nice wine and an apology note, not a pile of dirty pots for my renter to clean. 

- The dishwater is faulty and did not clean dishes, It would run, but the dishes were still filthy after a cycle. I am an adult and quite familiar with using dishwashers, the owner instead of coming by to see for herself decided to give me a lesson on how to work the dishwasher. Regardless, I can attest that after 5 cycles the dishes never got clean. So, I spent two weeks having to hand washing all the dirty dishes. 

- The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully, it was restored fairly quickly but no utility contact/account info was given in her inadequate ""welcome book"", so I was unable to get updates as to when the power would return. 

- The garage door is controlled by a digital lock with code but the system is funky and gave me trouble a few times. Additionally the garage is very small. The front door digital lock with code is also difficult, it seems to time out and the only thing to do is wait 15 minutes for it to reset. I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. This is a basic safety issue and for this reason alone the apartment should not be rented until it is corrected. 

- Finally, the washer and dryer are in a janky downstairs room which is very grimy. The washer/dryer is not listed in the ""welcome book"" forcing me to inquire (yet again) about their whereabouts and usage. 

- I travel and use short term rentals 6-8 times per year and this experience was pretty awful. Wendy the owner was “mostly” responsive but consistently condescending. She also offered no credit for any of the above issues. Well, she did offer to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth leaving at that point. 

- In conclusion, don't judge this book by its cover!"

Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300! We should have trusted our gut instinct as we knew before even getting to the property something was off with this “host” and sure enough. He admitted to listening to us in our room in a text.

This MIL suite is at the lower portion of a house, with a fully separate entry. It was really good to have a level entrance with no stairs! The electric fireplace was nice, WiFi/Internet great, parking was great, and owner communication was great!

The listing said full kitchen and we used the dishes, silverware, pots and pans, tea kettle, toaster, microwave, and dishwasher. We did not use the countertop oven. I appreciated knowing that it was a small refrigerator ahead of time, as it helped in planning what to bring/not bring. The listing I believe did say a stove, which was one of the reasons I selected it. What was in the kitchen was 2 burner ceramic/glass stovetop, which even with a users manual was a bit confusing for me to use. However in communicating with the owner my questions were cleared up. It might have been helpful to have pictures of the kitchen to see what was included. 

The weather when we were there was cold for the Seattle area so we used the wall thermostat/heaters and the space heaters. However we were also cooking at the same time on the stovetop and heating water in a tea kettle and the power went out in a portion of the kitchen and some outlets. To his credit, when we contacted the owner he quickly remedied the situation. 

We did not use the sunroom, but did enjoy the view of the creek, chickens, garden outside, and evergreen trees."

Sigh...we booked this place for a ten night stay in Salt Lake over the Christmas and New Year holidays. We checked in on the 23rd and walked into an attic apartment with no heat. It was 28 degrees outside AND inside the place. We could literally see our breath, standing next to the bed. 

Once I discovered there was no power to the thermostat, I contacted the property manager who, up until the day of check-in, had been very communicative. He (Eddie) told me he had never heard of this problem and asked me to send him a picture of the thermostat, my name, and the address to the property where we were staying. Um, okay. I did that and he told me he would get back to me. Luckily we had family to meet and we were able to go to dinner somewhere that allowed us to keep our car running so the dogs didn't freeze. 

While we were still under the assumption that the heater would be fixed eventually, we bought a space heater at Costco ($90) and a bag of ice melt ($10) to try to remove the snow and ice that were frozen on the Excorcist-style metal staircase. Oh, a couple more fun facts - there was no lightbulb over the door at the top of the stairs and also no mat outside the door to keep from tracking everything onto the kitchen floor. 

I'm going to spare the frustrating story of my texts back and forth with Eddie about the heater not working, the neighbors trying to flip the breaker, and the property manager not being able to reach a technician because it was Christmas and just skip to the part where Eddie told me his solution was to cancel our reservation and issue a refund. Whaaaaaaat???

And so...we had no where to stay. On Christmas, with two big dogs and a truck full of the things needed to live life away from home for ten days. We ended up finding a place eventually, but had to pay another $1000+ on top of the $900 we had already paid to VRBO. 

Eddie told us on December 23rd that we would received a refund. We received it (after multiple texts and emails,) on January 5th. 

I understand this apartment is only used as a rental property. It's bare bones, which would have been fine if there had been heat. There were towels set out for us, so it looked like someone had prepared the place for our stay. Only no one had prepared. You would think if you were renting a property in the middle of winter, you would check to make sure the heater worked. Maybe they should actually visit the property once in a while?"

PG&E had a power outage shortly after we arrived. When i message the owner he responded immediately and offered to drive up and start the generator for us. He also drove up 2 days before our stay to make sure the driveway and stairs were clear of snow. 
Little touches like bed trays set up ion each master bed made me feel like a special guest. I would definitely stay again."

Then after we were in the property, we were locked in by the gate that was jammed, and we couldn't leave until after 11PM. Which was one whole night gone. The next day was my best friend's birthday so of course we woke up early to start the day with breakfast and some sightseeing. When we returned to change for her birthday dinner the power was out! We were told that it was a power outage for the whole aera. So, we had to reschedule our plans for her B-day being that we couldn't get ready. On Sunday we had a stopped-up toilet that was flooding, and the tub was backing up. Notified host and was told Maintenace would be over to fix it immediately. We left and started with our day stayed gone all day. We were contacted by the host around 7pm saying that they couldn't fix the bathroom until the next day, but they would give us access to another room to use the bathroom. Which I responded was crazy begin that we are two women, and you want us to leave the apartment and go to another apartment to use the bathroom. The bathroom was left a mess in our unit. I also notified the host of the bathroom being a mess. Host stated that he would see if he could move us to another unit being that he didn't know the bathroom was left a mess, but we never heard from him again that night. We were also accused of flushing baby wipes down the toilet which was the reason they said the toilet and tub was backing up. We did not flush baby wipes down any toilet. Of course, after this I reached out to VRBO Support, but they were no help, only saying they would reach out to the host letting him know my complaints and he should be in touch with me. The host was in contact with me but for my complaints just to let me know the Maintenance team would be coming to fix the problem. I asked the host if he had heard from VRBO Support, but he said he didn't know what I was talking about. The issues were fixed in time for my best friend and I to go to her re-planned birthday dinner on our last night in Houston. I would not book this property being that the host is not any help when you have problems. I understand things happen but then you have to be responsible and accountable for your property."

Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “frat room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300! We should have trusted our gut instinct as we knew before even getting to the property something was off with this man and sure enough, it was a scam. He admitted to listening to us in our room in a text. Creepy, liar and WILL prey on those he knows can “afford” to pay more"

They did not. In fact they were out there cleaning up and moving limbs and trees in between the storms. They were determined to make our wedding weekend happen.

The condo is located right off the Corridor run. A little bit of a push to get yourself to the Gondola but easy to get to when ending for the day. 

A couple of days before our stay was over, the lighting fixtures above the dining area and kitchen went out. Charlotte was quick to respond when messaging her early in the morning and said she would get someone there soon. I wish communication was better here as while a maintenance guy was sent over to repair the light fixture, he ended up leaving me with no power at all. I had to communicate with Charlotte to get power back after the maintenance guy left for over an hr.

I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted."

Comments from a couple of the other guests:
“… the house was absolutely fabulous — well-appointed and perfectly on theme. Rob was by far the most helpful and responsive property manager I’ve ever worked with. When advised the first morning that the master bath toilet wasn’t usable, he sent Christian over right away. Christian had it repaired and the bathroom cleaned within 2 hours. Great, friendly service!”
“Outstanding customer service. Very responsive to any issues, including going above and beyond during a local power outage to ensure we were ok and even brought lanterns. 
Location is quiet, yet still close to downtown and local attractions. 
Décor and usability of the home is excellent. Well-appointed kitchen. Practical yet stylish furnishing. LP collection is so FUN! 
Perfect space to relax and enjoy all that PS has to offer.”"

Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcoholic or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection.

The property itself was also very nice. It's a studio in the lower level of a little bungalow, but felt spacious and was comfortably arranged. The bathroom was a nice size (bigger than I expected) and the kitchenette was well-stocked for what we needed. We dined out a lot, but there were plates, silverware, mini fridge, microwave, and toaster oven for leftovers (plus more equipment that we didn't use). 

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property. There were lots of coffee and restaurant options within 15 minutes' driving distance (many within 5 minutes), it was 20-30 minutes to the sites we wanted to see in San Francisco, and 60-90 minutes to nature areas like Muir Woods and Point Reyes. 

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable.

This was the ""Penthouse end unit"" I rented. I had the misconception that it meant a larger wrap around deck which it didn't. I arrived to the unit at 5 pm only to find the parking lot covered in the most disgusting mud I have ever seen. About a third of the parking lot was so deeply covered in mud you couldn't park so the rest of the spaces in the lot were always taken. I found a narrow slit to park in and slipped and slid all the way to the entrance. I ruined my new shoes as were covered in mud. This was from rains that occurred earlier in the week. The streams pouring on to the street and into the ocean there were carrying the mud from the mountainside and putting it everywhere including the beach and water which was now the color of my morning coffee. The unit itself is a well used rental and looks the part. The television in the living room was watchable but never managed to figure how to stream as I believe it wasn't connected to the wifi. The bedroom tv was postage stamp size which I never turned on. The unit had most everything there but just all basic and nothing one would consider luxury. Furniture was well used and just left the impression of minimal amounts to get the job done. The coup d' etat was that we were told to move our cars to clean the parking lot. The problem is there is nowhere to park your car off property and it was a half mile round trip for me to park my car and then I was stuck in the mud in the process. Totally uncalled for. The worst part was I sent a note to the manager explaining my displeasure but was told basically, mahalo. On top of that, when we finally decided to try the television after dinner to watch something the power went out for 2.5 hours. The best part was the beach to the south was most interesting and a great place to watch sea life and the sunset. When you check in they require you to get a parking pass and such. The problem is they are only open from 9 am to 2pm which is difficult since you can't check in until 3 pm. The last straw was it was unit 601 which is directly on the street of Kihei blvd and so the noise was ungodly. I never, ever would have rented a unit like this in that location but you don't know. The view was even compromised and the picture they use is from the one angle you could actually see the water decently. During a zoom call I had to mute my mic due to the noise."

It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone."

The property manager did not have the driveway cleared. We shoveled it ourselves. There was no salt. 4x4 truck not keep cold get up it. Pure ice. Manager did not reply. Power went out on day 2 of stay and we left due to no heat. Charged for all 3 days.

Still no reply.

Day two we shoveled again and had to shovel the road way as well. Yes we had chains. Beautiful place, perfect for a ski weekend, if you have a snowmobile… otherwise don’t bother at all."

I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room all over sofa. I immediately contacted owner who apparently lives close. Instead of coming over to look right away she instructed me to put pots out to collect water and roofer would come Monday. Monday it was fixed BUT she actually left me the pots in the sink to clean myself!! Unreal. I would have left a bottle of good wine if it was my place! The dishwater did not clean dishes adequately. I am 46 and very familiar with using dishwashers, since the owner seemed to think I needed a review, and can attest that after 5 cycles my dishes were not clean. The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully it was restored fairly quickly but no utility info was given in her shitty welcome book. The tv in the bedroom did not work initially. The garage door is funky and gave me trouble a few times and is VERY small. The front door punch code is also a pain in the ass and I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. Not ok and not safe. Additionally, the washer and dryer are in a janky room downstairs and very grimy. It also isn’t listed in her welcome book and I needed to inquire about their whereabouts and usage. I travel a ton and this experience was fairly awful. Wendy the owner was “mainly” responsive but super condescending and in no way offered any kick back due to my issues. She offered to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth me leaving at that point. I do not recommend!!!"

The location is the best spot on the whole island (central to everything and great beaches) favourite was the big beach.

The place was spotless! The cooler, beach chairs and water cooler was game changer. Full kitchen plus pay it forward is nice. (Forgot to bring shampoo and conditioner.)

I had to work on this vacation the wifi worked great. 

We had one minor power outage, think maybe 2 hours. We were gone that day, so that we wouldn’t have even noticed. Kev checked in, gave us an update, and told us where the flashlight was. 

Kev gave some great recommendations of things to see and do. Defiantly will stay here again."
