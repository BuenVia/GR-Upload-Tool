Our host from the onset was very communicative and quick to respond. The apartment had been cleaned early and she reached out to let us know we could check in early even though we didn't ask for it so that was a nice touch, pity we weren't in town yet. 

The apartment was accurate according to the listing and nothing was not a surprise to us which is always nice.

I would say that if you are a tall person (6' 3""), like myself, I would just be a little wary as the ceilings are lower than usual apartments. The issue really wasn't the ceiling in my case, it was the door frames. I banged my head a couple of times not thinking but it was not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The bathroom was clean and had plenty of body wash, shampoo and conditioner which was nice to have. 

I would recommend the host to add aluminum foil in the apartment because one day we made frozen pizzas in the oven and as the tray provided had gaps in it we had a little bit of a crumb cleanup because it was impossible to prevent crumbs falling through. 

Parking at the property was very convenient with a caveat. Parking is in the alley way where it's super tight. With a passenger van it's a tight squeeze and you have to be super careful not to not anything. 

Overall, it was a great stay hence the 5 star rating. Thank you for a lovely stay. Would certainly recommend to anyone."

It’s well maintained and clean. 

However, since it looks like it’s a new construction, we had a couple of issues. One is that on the stairs going down to the basement, there were exposed staples which cut my friends foot as she was doing down. I sent pictures to the Vacasa host but no real response and it wasn’t taken care of. This is a safety hazard. The second, and less important, issue was that the hot tub wasn’t properly working. We were able to
Resolve this with help from the Vacasa team but took a long time and we couldn’t use the tub.

Overall, nice house but with some issues."

It's a beautiful property. We also hired chefs through Sandra's kitchen which made for a comfortable eating experience. Most of the bedrooms had a mildew smell, which I suppose is understandable in a tropical environment. Unfortunately, one of the lasting memories of our stay were two of my family members injuring themselves on a missing step on the path into the water. One family member bloodied up his lower leg badly and another family member ended up falling and hitting her head and chest. It has been two weeks since our stay and unfortunately her chest pains are still there. I've notified the property manager of the issue so I hope it won't affect future guests."

There was a lot of things to do. It is very close to many activities and places to sightsee. Only complaints were the fireplace had not been cleaned out and my husband had to spend a bit of time cleaning it out and around it before we could use it. Also none of the rugs are secured down. Every time you step on them they slide around. Both of us almost fell several times and my son fell multiple times. Luckily no one got hurt.

Just a short walk to any food you could want and the beach, it’s centrally located. The hill is a beast, but a good way to get in a short workout. Older folks or anyone with knee or hip problems will require a golf cart to access the property up and down. Lots of stairs to get in also, so if you have elders or injured, maybe hard, but worth it for the views this place provides. If your a night owl, good for you, because between 11pm-4am every night every dance club in town pumps their music as loud as possible and there is no avoiding it. Bring earplugs!

There were some things that need improvement. The location in proximity to stores and disney world parks is perfect. It is a little farther from the pool area than we usually prefer. This is a very large complex.
They did provide a pack n play and kids dishes which was great. However there is not 1 single pan to be used in the oven. This house has 5 bedrooms with atleast 1 themed for children, children who typically love fries and chicken nuggets, we need a baking pan.
Also, the kitchen table and coffee table are not kid friendly. They are glass with pointy corners.
The kitchen table has a sharp metal piece on the under side that I cut my leg on twice, we then put a bandaid over the metal.
There are lots of dirt and markings over the walls, not a game changer but aesthically displeasing.
There are a few light bulbs that need to be changed. The lights would turn on and then flicker off after 20 minutes. 
The pool table sticks had broken tips.
The most annoying thing about staying here is that there is terrible cell service so wifi is a necessity. Well the wifi did not work for the first 3 days. I was able to contact someone when we left the house but then did not receive the response until the next day due to no service. When the company came to fix it they told us it's known that cell service here is terrible. 
Since we stayed here for our disney vacation I had to get up early to go to Starbucks down the rode 3 mornings in a row to book genie +, this was highly frustrating.
Overall, the house for the price was a bit disappointing but once the wifi was fixed it served its purpose for sleeping there while enjoying the parks. There are a lot of little things that need to taken care of."

When I fell and broke my wrist he took me to the clinic, stayed to do the translation for us and only left after we were seen to. After we got home, he came over and drove us to a mall so that I could get the brace that I need for my wrist. Then he drove us around the area by the house and pointed out the shops, stores etc. He was always available to answer any question we had, When we had a small problem with the hot water, he came over right away to see what was needed, it turned out to be that we needed gas.
The house was as advertised, very nice and clean with lots of the things, dishes, utensils etc. we needed. He had even put a lovely chocolate cake in the fridge for our arrival. I highly recommend this house to anyone interested. It is in an ideal location and close to a lot of stores. When I return to Merida I'll certainly rent this property again.."

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps."

Since we were staying for two months, I assumed I would need to replenish the paper products myself. I was wrong - there was plenty of TP and paper towels for our entire stay! The kitchen was also well stocked. There were even a few of my favorite Pampered Chef tools available, much to my delight!

It was mainly my husband and I who stayed here but the other rooms were used off-and-on by our adult children and grandkids. All the beds were very comfortable, and we were happy to use the portable playpen for the new baby and the toys and books for the 3-year-old.

There was no carpet and no stairs - which worked fantastic for my blind dog and my husband, who dislocated his ankle and broke his fibula shortly after arriving in Missoula. So if you are looking for an easy-to-maneuver house, this one will work great! :-)

The only suggestions for improvement is that the couch, although a perfect fit for the living room, definitely should be updated (owner said this is planned for spring), and the neighbors, while friendly, did not shovel the driveway as planned every time it snowed. In Missoula, snow tends to melt on the driveway within a couple of days anyway, but with my husband in a boot and on a scooter, he was not able to shovel the driveway himself so sometimes it was snow-packed for a few days.

Communication with the owner was pleasant and quick. She even left Griz onesies as a present for our new grandson - very thoughtful! We will stay here again!"

The pool is described as chilly…it was freezing and mostly in the shade as was the lovely courtyard. We swam in it only twice. The open areas in the main floor bedroom bathroom and on staircase allowed animals into the main living area. The host resolved this by having the maintenance man affix a lock on the door leading to the upstairs bedrooms but nothing was done about the bathroom. Animals still got in.

The security was dismal. Our separate poolside flop house( for which we spent 1/3 of the price)did not lock and the door screen blew in the wind. If we left the glass door open to the breeze a cat came in through the screen! One panel in the outside shower ( our only shower in the cabana bedroom)was broken so you were naked to the island. We had to figure out how to make the water warm. 
There were six of us but 5 beach chairs. The snorkeling equipment was too old and not effective. No hand towels or washcloths and only one dish towel. We could not wash towels and reuse as the dryer was broken the whole time! We had to haul gallons of water because the manager told us not to drink the filtered? water. There are no deadbolts as advertised. 
The manager and his girlfriend stayed under the main house which made us worried about being noisy at all. 
The furniture in the main house was quite shabby. Uncovered metal leftovers of buttons cut into your legs when you sat on the couch. Honestly? It would have been an adventuresome fun rental if we paid half the price. We felt taken."

The floors in 1210 were a danger hazard- the transitions between the tile and the laminate were poorly installed and uneven. Between the kitchen tile and the laminate, large portions of the transitions have come unglued. One of our friends slipped and fell and hit his head. There are other areas in the upstairs and downstairs bedroom where the laminate floor is also uneven. After that incident which we contacted the owner we decided to cut our stay short and leave two days early. She acted suspicious so I sent her a photo of the area were our guest tripped.

A few inexpensive wifi extenders would do the trick. The house is showing some age and is in need of some maintenance. Small thing but they add up.

This condo was immaculate, perfectly stocked and appointed and the beds were super comfy. We loved our stay here and would definitely book again! Our boys had tons of fun in the water park.
We decided to head over to the beach one day aster we arrived and found a couple of the provided beach chairs had broken brackets - we made do and let the property manager know. And the next day we had new chairs! Great communication. 
The view from the balcony was awesome - can see the gulf, lots of pelicans resting on the pylons and lots of boats idling by. Thank you for a wonderful getaway!"

Feeling put in a difficult situation, and while another location was offered (didn't have a kitchen with cooking facilities), the manager/owner relented and gave us the room as originally booked. 

We were greeted by hostess upon our arrival and our departure - explained things to us. Gated community, clean inside and out, pool was fine. Bed was a little stiff. Had to call to get some extra pots and knives to actually cut with - got some hand-me-down replacements. No toaster no coffee maker. Gentleman-host was responsive, but seemed like he was having to play catch-up. 

The bathroom toilet leaked water onto the floor everytime it was flushed. It wasn't set properly and someone had been trying to fix with silicone without success. Had to mop the floor with bleach and water to kill the icky-ness and try and the smell.

Weekend guests in adjacent units arrived the night before we had to leave and for some reason were rearranging the furniture above us on the patio at 1am.

Just felt like it was someone's investment property and we were the cash flow. Spend the bare minimum in upkeep, get em in, get em out."

When we needed more coffee mugs they came right away. And they also replaced a speaker that was not pairing. Perfect distance from Broadway. Definitely got a nice workout walking up the hill. Everyone ordered the same Nespresso machine after our stay. I broke my arm 12 hours before our flight and a shower caddy or bench is needed in the shower. I’d want one even without a broke arm. Overall stay was pleasant. I’d stay there again.

O caseiro que deveria cuidar da limpeza externa e piscina, mal o víamos durante nossa estada. A casa necessita de uma reforma ampla, as camas são box, porém só tem uma espuma que vem na cama, ou seja, não tem colchão, as noites foram muito mal dormidas. Nas suítes inferiores não tem janela de ventilação, em uma determinada noite caiu um pedaço do forro de gesso, quase atingiu uma criança que dormia. No anuncio consta como 7 suítes e na verdade são 6 suítes e um closed que foi considerado como quarto. Pegamos dois dias de chuva, ai apareceram várias infiltrações pela casa, quando utilizávamos a churrasqueira era goteira pra tudo que é lado. No anuncio constava que água, energia e internet faz parte do aluguel, porém o proprietário queria nos cobrar R$300,00 por um caminhão pipa de água potável, isso gerou um stress devido as várias mensagens que recebi nos cobrando essa conta. Por fim, após uma ampla reforma a casa Boedo se tornará atrativa, mas antes que isso aconteça não recomendo."

Super cold every morning. Well below 60 degrees. The master showerhead holder was broke and fell on my head. The listing was for a king, queen and twin beds. There was a king bed and two bedrooms with twin beds in each of them. Totally misleading property....I don't recommend this to anyone."

My wife has mobility difficulties because of back injuries, and she found the stairs hard to climb. This is NOT William's fault - we should have asked more questions! Kitchen equipment was excellent. Justin was very helpful. We did not have wifi or phone connections in Costa Rica. We did not receive instructions on how to check in to the property before we arrived at the address, but we met up with Jus within a few minutes of visiting the Coastal Property Management office."

The location is good close to stores, rest. And fishing.
Living room: the couch if you sat on it you fell into it getting out was difficult. The tv screen was filthy, no cable just roku w/o password to stream. No welcome book most vrbos have to tell you how to work things etc. The floor is soft in places, warped and uneven, so are some of the walls.
Stove is uneven pan on top with egg and egg slides to the back, had to find a board to level the back. Handle to oven real.loose and wont broil. Sink sprayer wont spray. Pan in cupboard was covered in grease. Very few silverware, 
cooking utensils, or pans. 
Back door is very difficult to open, no lights out back.
Bbq burners were burnt through and could not use it.
Screws loose and sticking out on door hardware, cut my husbands finger"

The TV did not work and continuously showed a “No Signal” message. The biggest problem was the broken pullout sofa. My wife seriously injured her finger trying to fold the pullout to sofa mode. The sofa was broken and could not be stowed properly - no matter what we did. We notified the owner immediately. It took two full days to address the broken sofa. During that two day period the sofa could not be used for sitting or sleeping. We returned back after being out for the day and the sofa was folded back in place, but clearly still broken. We received NO message from the owner as to what the issue was or whether or not we could use the sofa safely. And the owner never inquired about my wives injured finger. On a lesser note, there were three interior lights that were not operational (probably just needed bulb replacement). The key to the front door or the lock needs repair as it was difficult to unlock. I plan to send photos of the broken sofa mechanism and my wife’s bloody and injured finger to the owner and Point pleasant Resort management."
