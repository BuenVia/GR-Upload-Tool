One of the main reasons for choosing the Cottage, given my brother-in-law is disabled, was the fact that there were no steps to be negotiated and the accommodation was all on one floor with each bedroom having an en-suite shower room. However, it was disappointing to discover that there were no grab handles in either shower room, which given that the word “accessible” is used in the description was somewhat puzzling.

We really liked the layout of the accommodation and the property is very inviting and comfortable. Unfortunately, the claim that there was a “fully stocked kitchen” turned out to be woefully untrue. Just by way of establishing some credibility we successfully ran 3 self-catering properties, 2 of which were in France and one in Dorset, for several years. Since all 3 properties had a dishwasher, then as is normal practice we provided double the quantity of crockery, glassware, cutlery etc. This property was supposed to house 6 people but there was not even 6 of everything, let alone 12! There were significant omissions too, the most alarming one being the lack of a coffee maker and a cafetière. Most places we visit these days has a Nespresso or similar coffee maker. There was also no teapot.
 
If we were being unkind then we could assume that the reason for the lack lustre approach to equipping the kitchen was meant to encourage guests to use the restaurant and that the self catering part of the business is a low priority compared with weddings, corporate events, hotel and restaurant. Clearly, we do not know how well the other properties are equipped, but what a shame that the wonderful renovation work has been undone by something which would be so easy to remedy."

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone."

My friends and I rent houses every year and I guess have been lucky with good experiences.

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and the Unit had no Wi-Fi !
Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote but NO Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager."

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps."

We took a chance in an unfamiliar area and were so happy we did! Indian Shores is in an ideal location, on a beautiful beach.
This unit is very dated, but met our requirements. The bonus was that the 2nd bedroom was set up as an office, perfect for my husband who works remotely. 
The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable!
The condo could have been cleaner on check in, but we bought some disinfectant wipes and cleaned ourselves.
Things to improve… there were no beach towels provided, which I found out before we left home; kind of annoying to take valuable weight in my luggage with towels. A scissor in the kitchen would have been helpful and a starter pack of detergent would have been nice. I needed to ask for a non-stick mat for the shower, as the tub was very slippery; it was delivered immediately. 
One of the blankets in the closet was extremely dirty… I asked and received a new, clean one, but they did not take the dirty one away.
Overall, we had a great 2 weeks and would definitely come back to this building, but probably in another unit."

Best view ever. The view compensated for the few issues we had. 
Plumbing( one sink plugged and leaking). We had other sinks so we managed. 
The jet tubs ( one did not work) the other we had a issue as well, 
One toilet needed repairs.
Turned off pump for the waterfall, after calling about noise etc. to the manager.
2 of 4 safe boxes not accessible. One lost key and the other a battery needed.
Main kitchen sink faucet plugged ( Edgar came to check it out).
During one yard cleaning there was a problem with a sewer smell.
Pool light out. It was repaired.
We are a clean group, did not opt for cleaning service. But tried to maintain cleanliness during our stay. The 2 mops were were discussting. 
A few tips for future renters:
Slip mats in bath rooms(for older renters (seniors ) or someone with disabilities
Slip free rug at the entrance and exits of the pool. My aunt ( senior) only entered the pool once because of the fear of falls.
A pail and good mop for those who like to sweep and mop during their stay.
Cleaning supplies too. 
A special thanks to Edgar! He was very knowledgeable about where to go . We brought inflatable’s to use for our stay, he got us a pump to blow them all. 
I know Zendis does not own all the homes surrounded the beautiful home we rented. The only thing making it perfect was the loud barks of the old big dogs in the am and the little dog yapping too. 
Loved staying thier great choice!!!!❤️"

- Only 1 roll of crappy paper towels when every place i've rented provides at least 2
- Hot Tub has some sort of slippery film across the entire thing (inside), causing many of us to slip and bruise easily
- No ziplocks, plastic wrap or foil provided like all other rentals provide (only two medium tupperwares available)

- The binder with all the house information was inaccurate - it provided a picture of the thermostat and rules for heating when it was not that thermostat at all. There's 1 heater total for both upstairs and down so drastic temperature change when going up and down
- Bear Box for trash was broken so had to leave trash in garage with previous renter's trash

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people

A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other!

And if romance is what you crave... I highly recommend pouring yourself a cocktail at sunset before slipping into the most deliciously positioned and well maintained hot tub! While gazing upon Lake Candlewood, you'll enjoy a front row seat to a stage honoring clear skies and dancing constellations! 
It seems your host, Peter, thought of every meticulous detail making this home a recipe for perfection! 
The kitchen is fully equipped for entertaining and creating a masterful feast, and the outdoor spaces make it nothing short of priceless for family gatherings and reunions! Additionally, the home feels like a 5-Star boutique resort! It's tidy, clean, and well maintained. I myself prioritize a good night's rest while on vacation and I must say, without hesitation that the master suite most certainly offers a such an experience with a king size bed not soon forgotten! And, no worries... food and spirit provisions are only minutes away, and if the detailed instructional guides lack the answers you seek, Peter is a phone call away!

Spent our whole first night trying to fix the fireplaces (neither worked). Called/texted the property manager several times before getting a reply. It was close to 10pm before we were able to negotiate and convince them to send maintenance. He got one indoor fire working but the outside one was broken. He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often. 

Next day we noticed the bathroom in the room on the right has no power outlet. Ironically, there is a hair dryer though.
The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far). 
Got home after a long day and ran to the bathroom (long shuttle ride) just to slip on a pool of water and dislocate my knee! Water was dripping out of the back of the toilet tank. I turned off the water and called/texted management for help. No one even responded until the next day! 

VBRO told me the host would contact me about our issues. It’s been over a week and no one has reached out. Worst trip ever!!"
