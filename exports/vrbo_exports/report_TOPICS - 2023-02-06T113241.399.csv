Checked in Sunday night and saw the first of many. Contacted the property manager and stated I needed pest control out there the next day. They said they would then said Tuesday. I was in town for business and moved all of my morning meetings to the afternoon to meet pest control between 8 and 12. Never showed, the last communication from manager was at 3:30pm asking me if pest control showed up. Dismissive of customer concerns which are legitimate concerns. Place did not have any smoke detectors, shares a water heater with the apartment upstairs so your shower is out of hot water in 5 mins. Will NEVER stay anywhere Silver Street Management is associated."

Although the condo appeared clean, it was infested with roaches. We killed at least 10 and the last morning when we got up before the sun and turned on the lights they were everywhere!!! Running inside the toilet bowl, in the kitchen sink, dozens of them running across the floors, it made me sick just thinking about them being in our food, clothes and beds! Also the first night our toilet was slow, by morning it wouldn't flush. We called Vacasa as directed and someone came within a couple of hours but was unable to fix it, he came back around 5:30 on Friday night to pick up his stuff and said he couldn't fix it and a plumber would have to come. I asked when he would be here and he said "" I don't know, it's Friday night so I don't know if he will come tonight"". He did not return that night nor the remainder of the trip, we never heard from anyone and when I sent a text message as directed I got a generic response saying no one was available at this time. We spent the remainder of the trip all having to share one bathroom. I spent an outrageous amount of money for 3 nights at the condo as a Christmas gift to my mom and daughter so that we could enjoy a special time together only to be disgusted, embarrassed and frustrated by the entire vacation. We've stayed at many VRBO type places and always had excellent experiencs, this was extremely disappointing. I sent a message stating I would like to speak to someone about my concerns however, as of today I have yet to hear from anyone. I am not the type of person to complain and I can overlook alot of things including a couple of bugs, but this was over the top when there are dozens of bugs and a toilet that never worked. I hope someone will contact me soon."

When we got there everything seemed clean the house was nice and as advertised. Within an hour we saw a cockroach and another one came up the drain as I was brushing my teeth and they were big! I sent a message out to Vacasa who only would respond by text and klept saying we will reach out to our team and get back to you. Someone from the team the next day reached out via text and told us he saw a roach the day before we checked in but they were palmettos and they were outside bugs and non invasive. I understand Floridians call their roaches that. They were most definitely cockroaches and many of them. He said he would order an extra spray but couldn’t get anyone there until Tuesday and we checked in on Saturday due to a holiday weekend. Still no word on Tuesday after reaching out to them many times, buying our own roach traps and spray, containers for our food, many nights of no sleep, constantly killing and watching for roaches. Wednesday the exterminator showed up and told us that we had a bigger problem and there was a leak in the plumbing and that they were coming up the drains from the sewer. He told us what we needed to do and boil water and pour it down the drains amongst getting a plumber. Mind you this is our vacation rental and we informed him we are on vacation not our house. Later that night we got a text from the local crew that we needed to switch houses due to “the bigger issue” and we would get some level of compensation. We were moved to another house not on the beach, the pool wasn’t heated and the neighbors hated having vacationers in the neighborhood and had protest signs in their yards. Long story short we also paid for heated pool it wasn’t heated or clean and they told us to clean it. They said we would be reimbursed for the pool not being heated. We moved houses, no reimbursement for the no heated pool or the stay with the infested house of roaches. Overall we had a horrible vacation and no compensation for anything NEVER will go to another Vacasa home again. Horrible!"

The place has everything you need for an extended stay. We stayed for three weeks and bought a vegetable steamer which we left at the property. Pics are accurate but we were told that the throw pillows were for staging only. Those are important to us for lumbar back support. The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues. That means it is mostly an issue with the router, not the modem or the internet connection to the property itself. Although, normal router was still good for YouTube or Netflix. The place was clean but I would say it needs a deep clean. Shower pan is one example. The bed is comfortable and linens are top notch. We did find baby cockroaches in the kitchen area and bathroom and bought the roach motel thing at the market. This is Hawaii and so, we weren’t surprised but also not great. Just keep your food containers sealed or in the refrigerator. Another con is the proximity to the pool and jacuzzi. Both can get loud at times. But noise cuts off if you close lanai door. Also, everyone is out of the pool area by 10 pm. The pro is that the unit is really super close to the pool and jacuzzi and we enjoyed them quite a bit. All in all, we would come back."

After cleaning was performed by a team called in by the agent, there were other issues. One bathroom was missed in the cleaning (my daughter had to clean the shower, floor, and excrement coated toilet bowl). There was a cockroach infestation (in kitchen drawers, dishwasher, bedrooms - we had to purchase surface spray and treat both inside and outside the house, plus go through and clean kitchen drawer contents). Three bathrooms needed tap repairs (taps broken and nonfunctional, and plumber attended the following day after we repeatedly requested same). Freezer was filthy with dried meat blood. In the front yard, there was dog faeces located in various places on the grass, as well as prawn shells in a few locations. Compensation of less than 10% of the total cost (including the dinner reimbursement) was paid, which I consider to be totally inadequate given the property was advertised as a luxury property with an expensive nightly rate. The first response from the local agent when we finally managed to get her to attend the property, was “I’ve seen worse”. Not exactly what you want to hear when you’re expecting a luxury getaway.
This is a real shame as the property is in an excellent location but has been let run down.
Quality control by the local agent leaves much to be desired.

The hot tub was dirty and drained and therfore not in working condition. This was misleading as it was shown in working condition in the photos. Also the second day we had no hot water. Someone did come fix that issue that day thankfully. Very very disappointed"

I decided to travel with my 7yr old to bring in the new year with my family who reside in PR. 1- a three hour delay check in. 2- it was not clean (dirty microwave with rice crumbs, windows dirty, patio dirty, dust accumulation on bedroom furniture, floors dirty throughout especially in bedroom and bathrooms) roach infested , unsafe electrical outlet was unable to turn air conditioner on in bedroom for 24 hrs until it was repaired it was sparking. The television was unable to be heard unless you were sitting directly in front of it, if you hit the remote to turn off a bedroom light or ceiling fan it would also activate the same in the other bedroom . The owner/ manager was contacted since the first day of arrival and each day afterwards . I told him that they had left a roach spray on the kitchen counter and it was empty , he never cared enough to send another or address the infestation of roaches. My 7 yr old was upset each day afraid to enter the kitchen because of the roaches. I have video and photos of my complaint and expressed my disappointment to VBRO and the owner. I submitted 36 attachments it was a total of (17) complaints to VBRO of my evidence photos , videos and the texts between the owner and myself . I am still waiting on a response. The date of incident 12-28-22 thru 1-3-23. This place was a true nightmare, I was embarrassed to even have my family over, my daughter was traumatized. THIS IS NOT THE OASIS AS DEPICTED AND DEFINITELY NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN."
