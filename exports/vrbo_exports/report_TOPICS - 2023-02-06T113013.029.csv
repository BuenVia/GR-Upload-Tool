House is more than 120 yards from the parking lot….it was not shoveled the entire time we stayed here. I called manager to clear the ice dam that was blocking front door, which they refused to do even after I calling to tell them I fell and broke my ankle. 
My husband ended up shoveling the walkway, three times. There is a terrible neighbor who yelled at us in the parking lot two days in a row. On our last day, he threatened to hit my husband with a ski pole. 
On top of the ice damn and no snow removal, the front deck was covered in dog poop. I asked the manager if they could clean it up, which they refused to do. We paid more than $10k for the time we rented this property, so hopefully you can understand our frustration. We will definitely NOT be back."

I've listed a few things below that were not up to par:
• The listing said there was a coffee maker but there was no coffee maker.
• The outlets in both bathrooms did not work.
• The door in one of the bathrooms was off the hinge.
• There were not enough blankets for the beds. I would recommend putting extra blankets in the closets for use if guests want extra blankets.

There were some things that need improvement. The location in proximity to stores and disney world parks is perfect. It is a little farther from the pool area than we usually prefer. This is a very large complex.
They did provide a pack n play and kids dishes which was great. However there is not 1 single pan to be used in the oven. This house has 5 bedrooms with atleast 1 themed for children, children who typically love fries and chicken nuggets, we need a baking pan.
Also, the kitchen table and coffee table are not kid friendly. They are glass with pointy corners.
The kitchen table has a sharp metal piece on the under side that I cut my leg on twice, we then put a bandaid over the metal.
There are lots of dirt and markings over the walls, not a game changer but aesthically displeasing.
There are a few light bulbs that need to be changed. The lights would turn on and then flicker off after 20 minutes. 
The pool table sticks had broken tips.
The most annoying thing about staying here is that there is terrible cell service so wifi is a necessity. Well the wifi did not work for the first 3 days. I was able to contact someone when we left the house but then did not receive the response until the next day due to no service. When the company came to fix it they told us it's known that cell service here is terrible. 
Since we stayed here for our disney vacation I had to get up early to go to Starbucks down the rode 3 mornings in a row to book genie +, this was highly frustrating.
Overall, the house for the price was a bit disappointing but once the wifi was fixed it served its purpose for sleeping there while enjoying the parks. There are a lot of little things that need to taken care of."

Our host from the onset was very communicative and quick to respond. The apartment had been cleaned early and she reached out to let us know we could check in early even though we didn't ask for it so that was a nice touch, pity we weren't in town yet. 

The apartment was accurate according to the listing and nothing was not a surprise to us which is always nice.

I would say that if you are a tall person (6' 3""), like myself, I would just be a little wary as the ceilings are lower than usual apartments. The issue really wasn't the ceiling in my case, it was the door frames. I banged my head a couple of times not thinking but it was not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The bathroom was clean and had plenty of body wash, shampoo and conditioner which was nice to have. 

I would recommend the host to add aluminum foil in the apartment because one day we made frozen pizzas in the oven and as the tray provided had gaps in it we had a little bit of a crumb cleanup because it was impossible to prevent crumbs falling through. 

Parking at the property was very convenient with a caveat. Parking is in the alley way where it's super tight. With a passenger van it's a tight squeeze and you have to be super careful not to not anything. 

Overall, it was a great stay hence the 5 star rating. Thank you for a lovely stay. Would certainly recommend to anyone."

It’s well maintained and clean. 

However, since it looks like it’s a new construction, we had a couple of issues. One is that on the stairs going down to the basement, there were exposed staples which cut my friends foot as she was doing down. I sent pictures to the Vacasa host but no real response and it wasn’t taken care of. This is a safety hazard. The second, and less important, issue was that the hot tub wasn’t properly working. We were able to
Resolve this with help from the Vacasa team but took a long time and we couldn’t use the tub.

Overall, nice house but with some issues."

It's a beautiful property. We also hired chefs through Sandra's kitchen which made for a comfortable eating experience. Most of the bedrooms had a mildew smell, which I suppose is understandable in a tropical environment. Unfortunately, one of the lasting memories of our stay were two of my family members injuring themselves on a missing step on the path into the water. One family member bloodied up his lower leg badly and another family member ended up falling and hitting her head and chest. It has been two weeks since our stay and unfortunately her chest pains are still there. I've notified the property manager of the issue so I hope it won't affect future guests."

My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps."

The pedestal basin in the ensuite is very loose and the first night my wife leaned down on it when it moved she fell over. Having no silicon seal is also a little unhygienic.
The tap in kitchen sink is very loose and you had to hold at the base when using it, again silicon seal not effective allowing water to splash under.
We only used the BBQ once as the tray in bottom with absorbent caught fire, i had gone into the kitchen and luckily my daughter saw the flames and i managed to extinguish. Definitely needs changing out.

All these are minor issues that could be easily fixed. Thanks for the use."

Since we were staying for two months, I assumed I would need to replenish the paper products myself. I was wrong - there was plenty of TP and paper towels for our entire stay! The kitchen was also well stocked. There were even a few of my favorite Pampered Chef tools available, much to my delight!

It was mainly my husband and I who stayed here but the other rooms were used off-and-on by our adult children and grandkids. All the beds were very comfortable, and we were happy to use the portable playpen for the new baby and the toys and books for the 3-year-old.

There was no carpet and no stairs - which worked fantastic for my blind dog and my husband, who dislocated his ankle and broke his fibula shortly after arriving in Missoula. So if you are looking for an easy-to-maneuver house, this one will work great! :-)

The only suggestions for improvement is that the couch, although a perfect fit for the living room, definitely should be updated (owner said this is planned for spring), and the neighbors, while friendly, did not shovel the driveway as planned every time it snowed. In Missoula, snow tends to melt on the driveway within a couple of days anyway, but with my husband in a boot and on a scooter, he was not able to shovel the driveway himself so sometimes it was snow-packed for a few days.

Communication with the owner was pleasant and quick. She even left Griz onesies as a present for our new grandson - very thoughtful! We will stay here again!"

The house was lovely, nicely decorated, very clean and spacious. The location was great, we were practically in the grounds of the abbey and the views of Whitby were amazing. We had zero complaints about the inside of the property. 

I did have a fall on the pathway leading to the door of the property as a large stone bollard was placed across the pathway and as there was no outside lighting and the bollard was not highlighted in anyway the fell over it in the dark and suffered some nasty cuts and grazes, it was a shame is it happened within two hours of checking in so put a slight dampener on the break! So just be careful of that bollard if you stay. 

We were really keen to re-book this place and we even had a few friends that were interested after we showed them the pictures however we won’t book this place again due to the after contact with Home Stay who are the company that look after the property. 

I left a couple of things behind at the house and it took 4 emails and 2 phone calls over a period of two weeks to finally be told they didn’t have my items. Two items were left in the washing machine by mistake and they have claimed that nothing was handed in. I know full well that they were left so to tell me that house-keeping didn’t find anything was a blatant lie as well as being fobbed off for two weeks. The items weren’t super expensive but did cost me £50.00 to replace, as one item was a equa-fleece dog all in one suit and a pair of bamboo socks. It was just so disappointing that they clearly have some very dishonest staff who would happily help themselves to guests property, whether that was keeping it themselves or disposing of it because they couldn’t be bothered to save it for me. 

I also sent through the pictures of my injuries after the fall and I just received a ‘sorry about that and the ‘bollard was put there by the neighbour so not really our problem’ type of response - despite the bollard being on the pathway leading to the door of the property. 

Anyway, all I would say is, the house is lovely you will not be disappointed but just be very aware of the stone bollard and do not accidentally leave any items behind as you will not see them again."

The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done."

If you're looking to rent somewhere that is comfortable enough to feel like someone’s vacation home, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.

The location of this rental was decent; it was very close to the Disney parks, Walmart, and within walking distance to the pool in the complex. The rental was also very clean, and reasonably accurate to the pictures in the listing. That being said, the rental itself needs some major TLC. The floors and showers squeak loudly, and the tiles outside of the children's room upstairs are cracked and broken. The springs in the large couch were broken/missing, so when you sat on it the frame of the couch dug into your legs. The beds are all extremely uncomfortable/lumpy, and the linens did not fit the beds very well, so they would come off the mattresses while we slept. The beds were so bad that my mother and stepfather ended up taking turns sleeping on an air mattress because they could not both sleep in the bed on the first level at the same time. The AC was locked at 73, and the temperature in the rental varied wildly between being extremely hot and very cold. All of the curtains were sheer so it was very difficult to sleep in as light would start coming in as soon as the sun started to rise. 

Additionally, the neighborhood the rental is in is a pain in the butt to get into; the guard gate will require that you stop and hand over the license of the driver before they will let you in (even if you are using an uber). This often resulted in a long wait if multiple people who are renting try to come in. There was also very little consistency in the check in process at the gate; sometimes we were waved through without a second glance, other times they wanted to verify in the computer that we were allowed to enter and we were stuck waiting for several minutes. We mostly used Ubers and Lyfts, and the drivers were frequently stuck at the gate waiting despite me calling ahead and letting them know to expect them. One night my husband and I came back around 1 am after a date night, and the guard gate was unmanned despite us knocking and calling, so our uber could not get into the complex. We had to get out and walk around the gate to get home, which completely defeats the purpose of having a guard gate in the first place!"

I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

The management company was very fast to respond- once because our internet went out and again because the hot tub started smelling. Both times the customer service was awesome.

One small con- the bedroom is at least 10 degrees hotter than the living room. Make sure you turn down the heat during the evening/night.

One big con- the bed. The first night my husband woke up with the worst neck pain and each night got worse. The last 2 nights I had horrible back pain. DON'T try the couch bed. lol

The UGLY: 3 of our people arrived early, 2 of them being police officers. When they arrived 1 of them sat on a wicker chair, and it collapsed.

He then proceeded to charge me over 500$ in damages. I tried to speak w/ him but he wasn't willing to communicate.

If they can fix the leaks & have actual beds(not air mattresses) for people this is a great place. But be aware, they will charge you for anything and not speak to you about your stay."

Super cold every morning. Well below 60 degrees. The master showerhead holder was broke and fell on my head. The listing was for a king, queen and twin beds. There was a king bed and two bedrooms with twin beds in each of them. Totally misleading property....I don't recommend this to anyone."

O caseiro que deveria cuidar da limpeza externa e piscina, mal o víamos durante nossa estada. A casa necessita de uma reforma ampla, as camas são box, porém só tem uma espuma que vem na cama, ou seja, não tem colchão, as noites foram muito mal dormidas. Nas suítes inferiores não tem janela de ventilação, em uma determinada noite caiu um pedaço do forro de gesso, quase atingiu uma criança que dormia. No anuncio consta como 7 suítes e na verdade são 6 suítes e um closed que foi considerado como quarto. Pegamos dois dias de chuva, ai apareceram várias infiltrações pela casa, quando utilizávamos a churrasqueira era goteira pra tudo que é lado. No anuncio constava que água, energia e internet faz parte do aluguel, porém o proprietário queria nos cobrar R$300,00 por um caminhão pipa de água potável, isso gerou um stress devido as várias mensagens que recebi nos cobrando essa conta. Por fim, após uma ampla reforma a casa Boedo se tornará atrativa, mas antes que isso aconteça não recomendo."

When we needed more coffee mugs they came right away. And they also replaced a speaker that was not pairing. Perfect distance from Broadway. Definitely got a nice workout walking up the hill. Everyone ordered the same Nespresso machine after our stay. I broke my arm 12 hours before our flight and a shower caddy or bench is needed in the shower. I’d want one even without a broke arm. Overall stay was pleasant. I’d stay there again.

The location is good close to stores, rest. And fishing.
Living room: the couch if you sat on it you fell into it getting out was difficult. The tv screen was filthy, no cable just roku w/o password to stream. No welcome book most vrbos have to tell you how to work things etc. The floor is soft in places, warped and uneven, so are some of the walls.
Stove is uneven pan on top with egg and egg slides to the back, had to find a board to level the back. Handle to oven real.loose and wont broil. Sink sprayer wont spray. Pan in cupboard was covered in grease. Very few silverware, 
cooking utensils, or pans. 
Back door is very difficult to open, no lights out back.
Bbq burners were burnt through and could not use it.
Screws loose and sticking out on door hardware, cut my husbands finger"
