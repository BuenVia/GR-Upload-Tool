There are not a lot of stores or restaurants open but it is wonderful to be at the seashore at that time of year. However, winter in Maine can be tricky. We experienced a snow/ice storm which resulted in an area-wide power outage. The house has a Generac backup generator which did not turn on when the power went off. We contacted Olivia who immediately contacted an electrician and boiler repairman. We felt lucky that these very busy tradesmen were able to come over soon and remedy the problem, particularly since much of the area remained out of power for up to several days. Putting that experience behind us, we enjoyed a very peaceful stay and are grateful to Olivia for her prompt efforts to help us. We would not hesitate to stay here again."

Inside the property, we had everything we needed, and aside from the power going out one night, it was a perfect stay! I would definitely recommend the place, its amenities, and especially the owner and the communication by everyone involved.

We had everything we needed in the apartment, even to cook!

Turns out that the breaker panel is in the hallway - I ended up resetting the breakers myself - but it's crazy to have a breaker panel that any tenant could meddle with in an open hallway. On my last day there I was given a new code to open the main entrance door to the building. The explanation to use the new code was totally inadequate - I ended up standing out in the cold for 10 minutes at 12:45 am while trying to figure out how to get into the building. I ended up having to WAKE UP the superintendent to get into the building. Not a happy experience. The unit had a nice clean bathroom, the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had ""barely adequate utensils which were all very old and very well used.

I would have loved seeing the beautiful view from the master, but the electronic blinds did not go up. When I asked the maintenance man (who was there fixing our heat) about it he said they were waiting on a part to fix them. That was a huge disappointment considering what we paid for the view.

A plumber did not arrive until noon the NEXT DAY. On our last night at around 5:15 our power went out. At 5:55 we were told that we would have to move to another ""upgraded"" location. It was a hassle to pack up our perishable food that we were cooking for our farewell dinner that night let alone trying to find our things in the dark. The new location was not an upgrade. We did not have any Ocean view: it was 3 blocks from the water, nor could we hear the waves as we could at the other location. It only had 1 & 1/2 baths, so we were back to one shower for 3 women. We ended up not being able to eat our dinner until 11PM that night. I sent a text to Dunlop stating that we were dissatisfied and why at 6:52PM and was told by text that the ""Office Manager will call you first thing in the morning"". She did not call until 12.

They are kind, generous, and communicative, and their home is perfect--clean, tidy, organized, well-suited for families, great local facilities, and close to the mountain (ski-on/off).

Why am I so glowing in my review? Well, we had a snafu in our original plans. Two families (4 adults and 6 young children) checked into a different house. One snowstorm later (great for skiing, less-so for our housing), our original home was without electricity, running water, or heat. The management company promised us we'd ""be taken care of"", but by 6 PM the power wasn’t on and the management company abdicated their responsibility--we were stuck and left homeless.

After a quick Vrbo search, we came upon Mike & April's abode. They quickly responded and lent a hand, made their home available that same night, and immediately got the house cleaned/prepped. Within hours, our travel group was nestled into Mike & April's warm, welcoming home.

The rest of our stay was blessedly uneventful with 4 comfortable nights at Mike & April's. It fit our 2 families easily, was well-maintained, and truly made our vacation! Throughout our time, Mike & April were available for anything we may have needed and made us feel welcome and at home.

All-in-all, I cannot recommend them more. Thank you Mike & April for saving our vacation and making it even better!!"

However, be aware that this is a typical rental unit, with basic amenities, most of which were in working order. The carpets and lanai furniture require cleaning. A lot of the cookware is warped, so less efficient on the glass cooktop.
However the biggest issue was that the power went out one day. It took 5 hours of calling the property manager to figure out that the owner hadn't paid the electric bill of $233 and 2 more hours before the power was restored. Who does that to their tenant?
The price is also a bit steep, compared to the prices quoted by other renters.
So be aware of these issues before you book."

We reluctantly decided to stay due to already paying. The “host” met us in the driveway and right off the bat after showing me where to park yelled at me when I tried pulling up in the driveway because he felt he needed to watch me park as to not hit the mailbox. Once taken to the door he opened it, told us to take our shoes off as his wife had just “vacuumed “ the bright pink carpet 30yr old dirty carpet, took us up to the “room” in which looked like we were in a converted attic and we actually laughed the 2 days we were there as if we had a 1st college studio this would have been it!! Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300! We should have trusted our gut instinct as we knew before even getting to the property something was off with this “host” and sure enough. He admitted to listening to us in our room in a text. We rent regularly and have had wonderful experiences with all other hosts. Very sad. I hope Vrbo does inspections."

The listing said full kitchen and we used the dishes, silverware, pots and pans, tea kettle, toaster, microwave, and dishwasher. We did not use the countertop oven. I appreciated knowing that it was a small refrigerator ahead of time, as it helped in planning what to bring/not bring. The listing I believe did say a stove, which was one of the reasons I selected it. What was in the kitchen was 2 burner ceramic/glass stovetop, which even with a users manual was a bit confusing for me to use. However in communicating with the owner my questions were cleared up. It might have been helpful to have pictures of the kitchen to see what was included. 

The weather when we were there was cold for the Seattle area so we used the wall thermostat/heaters and the space heaters.

- I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room (all over sofa). I immediately contacted owner who lives close by but instead of coming over to look, she instructed me to put pots out to collect dripping water and that a roofer would come by Monday. Monday it was fixed but she left the dirty leak collecting pots in the sink for me to clean myself. Had I been the owner, I would have left a bottle of nice wine and an apology note, not a pile of dirty pots for my renter to clean. 

- The dishwater is faulty and did not clean dishes, It would run, but the dishes were still filthy after a cycle. I am an adult and quite familiar with using dishwashers, the owner instead of coming by to see for herself decided to give me a lesson on how to work the dishwasher. Regardless, I can attest that after 5 cycles the dishes never got clean. So, I spent two weeks having to hand washing all the dirty dishes. 

- The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully, it was restored fairly quickly but no utility contact/account info was given in her inadequate ""welcome book"", so I was unable to get updates as to when the power would return. 

- The garage door is controlled by a digital lock with code but the system is funky and gave me trouble a few times. Additionally the garage is very small. The front door digital lock with code is also difficult, it seems to time out and the only thing to do is wait 15 minutes for it to reset. I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. This is a basic safety issue and for this reason alone the apartment should not be rented until it is corrected. 

- Finally, the washer and dryer are in a janky downstairs room which is very grimy. The washer/dryer is not listed in the ""welcome book"" forcing me to inquire (yet again) about their whereabouts and usage. 

- I travel and use short term rentals 6-8 times per year and this experience was pretty awful. Wendy the owner was “mostly” responsive but consistently condescending. She also offered no credit for any of the above issues. Well, she did offer to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth leaving at that point. 

- In conclusion, don't judge this book by its cover!"

He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often. 

Next day we noticed the bathroom in the room on the right has no power outlet. Ironically, there is a hair dryer though.
The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far). 
Got home after a long day and ran to the bathroom (long shuttle ride) just to slip on a pool of water and dislocate my knee! Water was dripping out of the back of the toilet tank. I turned off the water and called/texted management for help. No one even responded until the next day!

Sigh...we booked this place for a ten night stay in Salt Lake over the Christmas and New Year holidays. We checked in on the 23rd and walked into an attic apartment with no heat. It was 28 degrees outside AND inside the place. We could literally see our breath, standing next to the bed. 

Once I discovered there was no power to the thermostat, I contacted the property manager who, up until the day of check-in, had been very communicative. He (Eddie) told me he had never heard of this problem and asked me to send him a picture of the thermostat, my name, and the address to the property where we were staying. Um, okay. I did that and he told me he would get back to me. Luckily we had family to meet and we were able to go to dinner somewhere that allowed us to keep our car running so the dogs didn't freeze. 

While we were still under the assumption that the heater would be fixed eventually, we bought a space heater at Costco ($90) and a bag of ice melt ($10) to try to remove the snow and ice that were frozen on the Excorcist-style metal staircase. Oh, a couple more fun facts - there was no lightbulb over the door at the top of the stairs and also no mat outside the door to keep from tracking everything onto the kitchen floor. 

I'm going to spare the frustrating story of my texts back and forth with Eddie about the heater not working, the neighbors trying to flip the breaker, and the property manager not being able to reach a technician because it was Christmas and just skip to the part where Eddie told me his solution was to cancel our reservation and issue a refund. Whaaaaaaat???

And so...we had no where to stay. On Christmas, with two big dogs and a truck full of the things needed to live life away from home for ten days. We ended up finding a place eventually, but had to pay another $1000+ on top of the $900 we had already paid to VRBO. 

Eddie told us on December 23rd that we would received a refund. We received it (after multiple texts and emails,) on January 5th. 

I understand this apartment is only used as a rental property. It's bare bones, which would have been fine if there had been heat. There were towels set out for us, so it looked like someone had prepared the place for our stay. Only no one had prepared. You would think if you were renting a property in the middle of winter, you would check to make sure the heater worked. Maybe they should actually visit the property once in a while?"

We were told that it was a power outage for the whole aera. So, we had to reschedule our plans for her B-day being that we couldn't get ready. On Sunday we had a stopped-up toilet that was flooding, and the tub was backing up. Notified host and was told Maintenace would be over to fix it immediately. We left and started with our day stayed gone all day. We were contacted by the host around 7pm saying that they couldn't fix the bathroom until the next day, but they would give us access to another room to use the bathroom.

I also notified the host of the bathroom being a mess. Host stated that he would see if he could move us to another unit being that he didn't know the bathroom was left a mess, but we never heard from him again that night. We were also accused of flushing baby wipes down the toilet which was the reason they said the toilet and tub was backing up. We did not flush baby wipes down any toilet. Of course, after this I reached out to VRBO Support, but they were no help, only saying they would reach out to the host letting him know my complaints and he should be in touch with me. The host was in contact with me but for my complaints just to let me know the Maintenance team would be coming to fix the problem. I asked the host if he had heard from VRBO Support, but he said he didn't know what I was talking about. The issues were fixed in time for my best friend and I to go to her re-planned birthday dinner on our last night in Houston.

Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “frat room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300!

On check out, host told me to message her directly on WhatsApp to reserve instead of the platform, a clear violation of VRBO’s rules and regulations. She then bombarded us with unwanted messages and solicitations afterwards. 

She also told us the 2 people before us mentioned they also had no direction where to put any trash either. And that they take care of it and laundry, when I told her we washed towels. Clean ones were in the dryer and ones that need to be washed were in the washer. This did not need to be done by us, but was done anyways.

There was also a non disclosed video camera recording the unit which is also another huge violation of VRBO’s policies.

Beds were very comfortable, but there was only one thick/firm style of pillow that will not work for stomach sleepers.
Pool or ocean are both a 5 minute walk away. And you are in walking distance to a few different restaurants. Twisted Lime was my personal fave. Just make sure you aren't starving before you get to the restaurant as service is quite a bit slower than we are used to in Canada. 
NOTE: Bon Vivants cafe and cocktail bar is directly below the primary bedroom. If you are an early to bed person, this would be an issue due to the late-night noise. However, we didnt understand hurricane doors - you have to pull the handle up to make the door shut properly. We didn't figure this out until midstay, which lessened the noise.
We went with our two children, 10 and 12, and felt quite safe. 
You can take the #10 bus to downtown Nassau. Route goes along the coast and is about a 20 minute ride. Bus can be caught anywhere on the side of the main road by flagging them down. And when you want to get off, just say ""bus stop"". Fare is $1.50 per person. NOTE: Do NOT take the #10A is this route winds inland and takes significantly longer. Cabs were more expensive than we were expecting, and they charge additional for more than two people ($50 to downtown one way for 5 people).
Overall, a really great place to stay, but everything was significantly more expensive than we were expecting in the Bahamas."

We thought everything was good after that but then we went to wash the dishes from our breakfast and the water wasn’t working. We contacted the company, bought a few gallons of water so that we could flush the toilets, and then went to the beach. The beach is not a short path away. It is a rather long road down several streets. We kept asking people we passed where the path was and they laughed and said we were better off driving. When we came back from the beach we started to make lunch and realized that even though the lights were on, the oven hadn’t come back on. So we went out to lunch. When we came back from lunch we put the babies down for a nap. We adjusted the heaters in the rooms and found out that the heaters weren’t working (neither the cadets in the wall or the ductless system that was lighting up like it was on but no air was coming out). We really wanted to stay and did enjoy our first night there, but we couldn’t figure out why the water, oven and heaters weren’t working. At that point we decided to end our trip early and go home to make sure it was safe for our babies who we were worried about getting too cold without heat.

Comments from a couple of the other guests:
“… the house was absolutely fabulous — well-appointed and perfectly on theme. Rob was by far the most helpful and responsive property manager I’ve ever worked with. When advised the first morning that the master bath toilet wasn’t usable, he sent Christian over right away. Christian had it repaired and the bathroom cleaned within 2 hours. Great, friendly service!”
“Outstanding customer service. Very responsive to any issues, including going above and beyond during a local power outage to ensure we were ok and even brought lanterns. 
Location is quiet, yet still close to downtown and local attractions. 
Décor and usability of the home is excellent. Well-appointed kitchen. Practical yet stylish furnishing. LP collection is so FUN! 
Perfect space to relax and enjoy all that PS has to offer.”"

They’ll say they will send it right over but you just need to be prepared it isnt timely and set your expectations for that. We ended up just washing our pool and shower towels. One front desk person was especially unkind. Housekeeping came to measure the curtains in all rooms unannounced the day before we checked out… they could have waited a day instead of interrupting our lunch. Pool was closed after big storm as well. That was understandable. But on top of all the fees paid through vrbo (hundreds and hundreds) there is another resort fee you pay. Id like some of these refunded for all the hassle. I have a list of all issues, days, number of calls, etc."

This was the ""Penthouse end unit"" I rented. I had the misconception that it meant a larger wrap around deck which it didn't. I arrived to the unit at 5 pm only to find the parking lot covered in the most disgusting mud I have ever seen. About a third of the parking lot was so deeply covered in mud you couldn't park so the rest of the spaces in the lot were always taken. I found a narrow slit to park in and slipped and slid all the way to the entrance. I ruined my new shoes as were covered in mud. This was from rains that occurred earlier in the week. The streams pouring on to the street and into the ocean there were carrying the mud from the mountainside and putting it everywhere including the beach and water which was now the color of my morning coffee. The unit itself is a well used rental and looks the part. The television in the living room was watchable but never managed to figure how to stream as I believe it wasn't connected to the wifi. The bedroom tv was postage stamp size which I never turned on. The unit had most everything there but just all basic and nothing one would consider luxury. Furniture was well used and just left the impression of minimal amounts to get the job done. The coup d' etat was that we were told to move our cars to clean the parking lot. The problem is there is nowhere to park your car off property and it was a half mile round trip for me to park my car and then I was stuck in the mud in the process. Totally uncalled for. The worst part was I sent a note to the manager explaining my displeasure but was told basically, mahalo. On top of that, when we finally decided to try the television after dinner to watch something the power went out for 2.5 hours. The best part was the beach to the south was most interesting and a great place to watch sea life and the sunset. When you check in they require you to get a parking pass and such. The problem is they are only open from 9 am to 2pm which is difficult since you can't check in until 3 pm. The last straw was it was unit 601 which is directly on the street of Kihei blvd and so the noise was ungodly. I never, ever would have rented a unit like this in that location but you don't know. The view was even compromised and the picture they use is from the one angle you could actually see the water decently. During a zoom call I had to mute my mic due to the noise."

Monday it was fixed BUT she actually left me the pots in the sink to clean myself!! Unreal. I would have left a bottle of good wine if it was my place! The dishwater did not clean dishes adequately. I am 46 and very familiar with using dishwashers, since the owner seemed to think I needed a review, and can attest that after 5 cycles my dishes were not clean.

The front door punch code is also a pain in the ass and I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. Not ok and not safe. Additionally, the washer and dryer are in a janky room downstairs and very grimy. It also isn’t listed in her welcome book and I needed to inquire about their whereabouts and usage. I travel a ton and this experience was fairly awful. Wendy the owner was “mainly” responsive but super condescending and in no way offered any kick back due to my issues.

The location is the best spot on the whole island (central to everything and great beaches) favourite was the big beach.

The place was spotless! The cooler, beach chairs and water cooler was game changer. Full kitchen plus pay it forward is nice. (Forgot to bring shampoo and conditioner.)

I had to work on this vacation the wifi worked great. 

We had one minor power outage, think maybe 2 hours. We were gone that day, so that we wouldn’t have even noticed. Kev checked in, gave us an update, and told us where the flashlight was. 

Kev gave some great recommendations of things to see and do. Defiantly will stay here again."

Unit over all is nice, def not meant for the number of people indicated you will trip over each other with all the cots and no room to walk! It is not a three bedroom unit, but two with a murphy bed in the living space tucked in the corner. 
Rules are listed everywhere as if you are all ready going to break something…. Do not expect any amenities…Decor is nice. 

The building is all short term rental so be prepared for drunken people knocking on doors. 

We were there Thurs - Sunday and the power went out, he didn’t have anything to say or help… and we are on a high floor of the building....

Checking out, we did as the rules said, throw towels in and put the keys back where they all were… 

Tues- he sends nasty messages about us ripping blinds off the wall and charges us fees for this… Mind you we checked out Sun and the key is in a very public location. We also asked for proof as he had two sets of blinds and one was not fully installed. 
No proof… 
Take a pass on this nice unit all bc of the owner"

Upon arrival the place was clean and welcoming. The location is great for all things in the Arenal region (Mistico, Rio Celeste, Hot Springs, etc). The experience of waking up to the sounds of rain, listening to Howler Monkeys and seeing Toucans at this property were absolutely amazing. The only issues we had were the check in/out process. We had to plan a time to meet with the property manager to obtain the keys/fob to get into the gated community and then we had to plan a time to leave. The communication behind this was tough as using USA cell phones in this area is almost non existent due to cell coverage. We also lost power for about an hour the day of check out and had to find a neighbor to help us get it back on. Overall it is an absolutely lovely place and the host does a great job of suppling a good amount of information about the area with their website/app. Highly recommend for families, just make sure to have prior communication with property manager about check-in/out process."

We did not appreciate having to pay an extra 30 euro late check-in fee because we arrived later than expected due to the rail strike on that day. The communication about the check-in process was terrible and we went all over the place trying to find the grumpy man who gave us our keys but was too lazy to even come up to the apartment to show us around. The apartment itself was quite run down and the power went out a few times when we plugged in the heater which had a short in it. There were a couple of issues that were rectified quickly but the hosts were very stingy about things like extra garbage bags or sufficient dishwashing soap for a two week stay. The big balcony facing the water was wonderful and there are many restaurants close by.
