However, the management group needs to get its act together. We are aware that check in time is 4:00 PM. However, for a Thursday check in it was likely that the unit was available earlier. No consideration was given to letting our group check in one hour early. Instead, it appeared that the computer was programmed to send a message at 4:00 PM without any human consideration. The unit needed work. The hot tub had so much ice around it and on the steps that it was unsafe to use. Additionally, the cleaning and inspection crew missed the four empty beer cans next to the hot tub. We had to order additional wine glasses as none were provided for a unit that accommodates eight. The spray attachment in the kitchen sink leaked and needed to be replaced. The kitchen sink clogged and needed clearing. The technician sent to fix things was cheerful and efficient. However, we were not on vacation to have things fixed that should have been taken care of before we arrived."

The home could use a lot of work to bring it up to the standard that the pictures would like you to believe you're walking into. Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken
-Most of the house windows were dirty also covered in spider webs
-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided 
-All the beds were very very hard, also terrible pillows, and beds were not made properly
-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry
-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay. If they do fix the issues the house would be great. So please do take care and decide carefully when booking, if these are things you can overlook then go ahead. If I had known this was what I'd be walking into I wouldn't have made this booking. I hope this helps in your decision making process."

Sometimes photos make a home look better than it is, this absolutely isn’t the case with Southern Pines (it’s even better in person!)
Other than the fact it’s beautifully decorated, open the cabinets and you’ll find all of the amenities of home (and probably more) sippy cups for toddlers, bath toys, plush robes, and every kitchen item one might need. We sat in the hot tub on the gorgeous deck as snow fell around us and planned our trip back in the summer when we know we’ll be able to hear the Blue River flowing just below us. My only complaint is that any other home rental we’ve booked since staying at Southern pines is just a let down. Once you stay at a home that is fully stocked, with comfortable beds, and beautiful decor- everything else just falls short."

This was our worst experience ever. We were told 12 days before check-in that the house was sold and were offered a different house with the same landlord. Upon arrival we found food in the fridge and clothes in the drawers. The property manager was not sure who they belonged to. Most of the kitchen drawers and downstairs closet were stuffed with things used in the remodeling/redecorating and had to be moved to allow for our things. The floors were swept but very dusty. The kitchen counters are nice but the island and cupboards are high and hard to access if your 5'5"" or under. The crispers in the fridge were frozen in place and even after we defrosted it there was water continually pooling in the bottom of the fridge during our entire month long stay. There is a nice backyard kitchen but we had to buy our own BBQ tank and utensils . The outdoor sink fills with the dirty water from the washing machine and leaves a horrible scum. The 6 foot ladder for the pool is ""floating"" and very unsafe. The property is fenced however there was no gate. The water in the bathtubs does not drain quickly so you are standing in inches of water while showering. There is no rod for hanging clothes downstairs and the TV did not have any reception and was not replaced until half way through our vacation. It is also in the bedroom so you have to sit on the very saggy bed to watch it. The upstairs living space is very tight. The rental sleeps 10 but only 3 or 4 people at most can sit on the sofas and the rest would need to sit on the dining room chairs. One of our ladies sat in a chair which broke when she pushed on the arms to stand up. The landlord is charging $300.00 for replacement of this one chair so be careful. The temperature fell to the low 60's for a couple days and there is no heat at all upstairs so it was very uncomfortable. The plug ins downstairs did not work and blew when trying to be repaired. Most of our vacation was spend trying to repair things or wait for repairs, lightbulbs etc. There are holes and gaps in the screened in porch. Neither of the dishwashers were secured to the counters so wobbled. There are no ""luxury"" touches like hair dryers or full length mirrors. The view is nice and there is a private park across the street but the key deposit is $600.00 and I am still waiting to get this back ."

From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.
You will enjoy your stay at the Nokomis pool house."

There is also 3 big screen tv’s, one in each room. More than enough towels and paper products for a family of 4 for 4 nights. Has a nice view of the pool and hot tubs and it was nice to see the steam coming off the water as the snow fell. It can get pretty windy at the top of snowshoe and we have stayed in other units where you didn’t want to go out on the balcony. But this unit’s balcony is somewhat protected by the winds. If your looking for a place in snowshoe, Allegheny is the best place to stay!! They have 2 hot tubs and a heated pool, cheat mountain pizza is located in the bottom of the building, ski lockers, nice lobby with a tv and fireplace, free entry to split rock (pool/hot tubs/kids water slides), 1 min walk, great location at one end of the village and your right there at the top of ballhooter lift. 
We are looking forward to staying here again!"

We loved the Coal coast and will definitely be returning to the area. It was relaxing, beaches great, fantastic walks and uncrowded. Sadly the property is rundown and the pool and deck were unsafe. Rusting steel and unstable decking around pool, dirty stained walls and broken rust in bottom of pool meant we were unable to use the pool at all. Our grandsons were devastated. Deck is also in need of urgent repairs with rotten boards and protruding nails. Outdoor cushions were wet , mouldy and filthy. Internally you could see they had started to work on improving the property but there is still a long way to go. For a $420 cleaning fee I would recommend cleaning windows, laundry sink and cupboard underneath and removing garbage stored in stables. We needed to buy plugs for kitchen sink, squeegee for bathroom floors, water glasses, cling wrap, foil.., Agent did come out to assist when we had problems with lights as they have quirks. We wish the agent well as he is trying to fix problems but it will take owner stepping up.

It was really nice to have beach toys, towels, chairs and coolers to use for our beach days. The washer and dryer was used daily and was nice to keep on top of laundry. My only personal complaint was the requirement to wash / dry all the towels before we left. With 4 kids it was a bit hectic and we had to time an early morning final swim to have enough time to launder all the towels. Everyone with kids knows one trip to the pool is 6 pool towels and then 6 bath towels so even though there is adequate towels it’s 2 loads of laundry just in towels which takes some time.

Property: If I owned the place then the property manager would be fired instantly.

The place overall feels very dated, the pictures make it look much nicer. Rooms were a decent size & beds are were comfortable but that’s about the extent of the good things. If you want to hot tub after, you’ll need to drive. 

Complex: This is the only place I’ve ever stayed at that doesn’t allow drinks (including water, which is a safety hazard IMO) into the hot tub area. I understand glass but having a beer in the tub after skiing all day is a staple for most people. There’s literally a guy checking as you enter the lobby to make sure you don’t have any drinks, and won’t even allow you to bring water to the locker room. He also closed down earlier than advertised so make sure to get there early. It felt more like being at church summer camp than on a ski vacation.

There was also not hot water on arrival. 12 hours later we did eventually manage to get the hot water going ourselves.

The main blind in the master bedroom was broken as was the sliding door to the outside deck accessed from the master bedroom. One of the light bulbs was also blown in one of the beside lamps and there we no spare light bulbs in the house. 

The kitchen sink tap had a leak which the caused water to pool across the bench top. 

We found pieces of glass and bottle tops in the swimming pool and spa. There were sticky gummy bears stuck to the dining room chairs and the couch was covered in hair and pieces of popcorn.
