We loved that we could sit outside and watch wildlife on the canal. Beautiful view. Unfortunately, the outside furniture was extremely dirty and moldy. We had to put a sheet over the cushion on the loveseat. The table had to be washed too. The deck was not safe and needed to be replaced. Fenced yard was great for the dog. 
We loved the house. It was roomy and comfortable. 
Inside was clean for the most part but I accidentally stuck my hand in grease left on the stove. Rug in master bed room has a corner the sticking up and is a trip hazard. Complain about it the 1st day and reminded them several times by text and email but it was 2 weeks before it was taped down. 
The neighborhood was good. Well maintained. House located on a court so no traffic. There was a unlicensed broken down car right next to the driveway that made it more difficult to back out of it. We were excited to have a garage but couldn’t use it due to the fact that it was full of stuff. It shouldn’t even be mentioned in the listing if you can’t park in it. 
We were there 3 weeks. We paid for a month but the day before we were leaving, my brother pasted away so we totally lost a whole week’s rent. Vrbo does not take into consideration the loss of an immediate family member."

However, it’s a little tired and rough around the edges in certain areas. Most of the decor and fixtures (kitchen, bathrooms etc) are dated and could do with an update. The first floor deck also feels a little unsafe and probably needs some work. Could be great with a little investment."

Fortunately the new manager was listed on one email and was very helpful. Beds were comfortable, and there was relatively new furniture, granite countertops, etc. but unit definitely showed its age and lack of thorough cleaning. Balcony railing was deemed unsafe and we were warned not to touch or lean on it by maintenance. Definitely showing its age."

It is mostly windows so the light is fantastic. There is plenty of room for spreading out inside: a large great room, open kitchen with everything you need, and beds are comfortable. We had a great stay, and the owner was responsive when we called with reports of two malfunctioning doors. On the less positive side: the deck and outside portions of the house show wear and neglect: moss is growing on much of it, with debris and green slick on others, some rotted boards, and a railing that fell off during out stay. The lights in the house are hard to figure out, and the fading magic marker scrawlings on the faceplates add no charm. The lower level storage space is messy, and we found a “surprise” in one of the drawers upstairs. A little more attention to detail and this will be a fantastic property."

We had dinner on the deck most nights. I advise replacing all the nails in the deck with stainless steel screws before they become a trip or injury hazard. They are all ""popping"" and hammering them down again will not prevent this. It is caused by the timber shrinking and swelling."

Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing."

But requires a bit of maintenance, with leaking shower heads and no drains in the bathrooms for the water. Also unsafe balcony rails, loose glass panels and loose cables from faulty work. The lock box for the property key was corroded up, also some sliding doors wouldn't slide or would fall of their rails.
The property is also like two separate residences as it's not very interconnected.
Finally was advertised as both a 6 bedroom and a 4 bedroom by Stayz which was very confusing 😕."

Hosts provided everything you would need and the place is very nice. Slider was broken when we went (hosts left a message apologizing for inconvenience on slider) so couldn't use the balcony, but it was raining while we were there so that wasn't an issue for us. Parking is basically street parking (just off street, but no gate or anything) so I was a bit concerned about break-ins, but nothing happened while we were there so my concern was for naught. Do pay attention to the ""two flights of stairs"" in the listing though as that was the only part that I wish I had put more thought in to :-). Overall, I would gladly stay here again."
