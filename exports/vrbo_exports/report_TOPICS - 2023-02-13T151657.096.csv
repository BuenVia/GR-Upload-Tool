Unit could use remodeling/updating its pretty run down but we don't stay indoors. Since this unit sleeps 6 there should be 6 of everything not only 4. Owner should purchase hangers and supply more in the kitchen however great communication. Wifi was terrible and only working in master bedroom area. Views were awesome and resort Ok. They are very strict on bringing coolers by pools and make you buy stuff there which is hefty however you can go to the beach. Bar was awesome great drinks and food but again pricey. Pools were pretty dirty when we were there tons of sand at the bottom. Check in process very friendly and smooth. Valet was great but expensive. Overall 3.5 rating. We will come again but more prepared. Cheers!"

The view from the balcony is lovely. The property would be improved by replacing the filthy carpet with tile or laminate, sharpening the very dull kitchen knives and communicating with the guests about important things like how to get pool towels, how to get clean bath towels, etc. The bedroom would be improved with a night table on both sides of the bed and by replacing the hanging rod in half of the closet with shelves. The bathroom needs more storage and a big walk in shower would be better than a bath/shower combo. Also, the balcony needs a sun shade so that it can be used throughout the day. Considering the volume of citrus fruit in the area, a citrus squeezer in the kitchen would be useful. We enjoyed the nearby hot tub during the cool evenings."

You can see right through the entire home due to only having indoor/ out door blinds.. the hot tub was completely disgusting and green. Smelled like mildew and wasn’t even plugged in. Communication with staff trying to get someone out was ridiculous and took 18 hrs for someone to show up un announced . I drained and cleaned the hot tub myself. But it never even heated up fast enough for us to use. Neighbors window stay open and have zero privacy including that owner has a ring camera on the back door looking right at the hot tub. Wouldn’t book this house ever again. Absolute Waste of money."

The location is absolutely perfect! So many restaurants, great area to walk around, Oasis pool is great for kids and adults. The house was a good size and easily accommodated groups 6-12 comfortable with plenty of bathrooms and beds. Now for the not so good.. the house was dirty! Walls look like they’ve never been cleaned, hair and dust on the floors and don’t me started on the carpets, GROSS. Having little kids with us I was constantly on edge as to what they put in their mouths and touched. Oh and also the pool was disgusting!! Upon calling about the pool being heated they said they never received the request and it would take 18 hours when we sent the request back in October. Okay fine, maybe it was overlooked not a big deal since the clubhouse pool was so nice and close by. But, the worst communication came when they sent me an email prior to arrival that all guests were added to our stay, we’ll Ofcourse they were not and everyone except myself got stuck at the gate waiting for me to get ahold of someone during non business hours (I finally got an answer after my 16th call to them). This property just added a lot of stress to what should have been a relaxing vacation stay. I have stayed at so many VRBOS & Air BNBs over the years and have never had an issue. Anyways, don’t let my experience sway you from coming to this property… a little better customer service along with a new cleaning company could make your stay great!"

An SUV is a must since the roads are all dirt and have horrible dips. They only had a little car and we got 2 flat tires from the roads. We had no running water for 16 hours during the week. Then we had no power or water the last day we were trying to pack up to leave. The sofa was pretty dirty and you didn’t want to use. The shower head has such lower water pressure it’s hard to get all the shampoo and conditioner out so, I looked like a grease head the whole time. The pool was dirty when we arrived and after 8 days it was still never cleaned. There is a canopy over the pool which has large carabiners connection which was fine until the wind blows in the night and they are banging on the the roof all night long. There was weeks worth of bird poop on the deck in which we scrubbed for a while trying to clean because you couldn’t access the door way without stepping in it."

Wi-Fi info was incorrect (reached out and they told us the correct info) the owners also reached out and explained that the hot tub was dirty with dirt from previous guests which I understand these places flip people pretty quick but that was a big turn off hearing that so we didn’t even use it. There were 2 vehicles in the driveway when we got there. Owners explained the previous guests rental died and had to get towed which is fine but there was also a black suburban that has been sitting there for a while. Just doesn’t look inviting. Overall it was a good stay. You can tell it’s being remodeled by the owners but I’d book again for sure but fix the flooring and remove that suburban. View is incredible I will say that! Also restaurants and grocery stores are 20 minutes away. Only thing close is a gas station."

The aircon is only in the living space and small upstairs tv room, so even though there were fans in bedrooms it was a bit hot and sticky, and if you aren't a big fan of sharing your space with nature you'll want to keep all the beautiful shutter glass windows closed, there are no fly screens on the main living area windows. But apart from those two technicalities we had a great time. When we arrived the pool was pretty dirty but it was because the vac had stopped working, and when i called they sent someone straight over and it was sorted super quick.

When we arrived the other guest apparently decided it was only their property and proceeded to have the tv on for the next eight hours at a level that can only make one assume they were born deaf and couldn’t afford hearing aides. They also had a dog that barked at 3:30am. Being up until 5 am with them was not my plan. The pool was kind of dirty also. And when we arrived there was a truck blocking the driveway also. And the air for the unit was controlled by the other guests. Which made it a stifling box of hot air with no air movement whatsoever. I emailed the property and asked for a refund as we weren’t returning and never got one.

The home could use a lot of work to bring it up to the standard that the pictures would like you to believe you're walking into. Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken
-Most of the house windows were dirty also covered in spider webs
-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided 
-All the beds were very very hard, also terrible pillows, and beds were not made properly
-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry
-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay. If they do fix the issues the house would be great. So please do take care and decide carefully when booking, if these are things you can overlook then go ahead. If I had known this was what I'd be walking into I wouldn't have made this booking. I hope this helps in your decision making process."

There were 11 of us and there was plenty of room at the large kitchen table for us to eat together and plenty of seating in the living room. You cannot beat the view out to the ocean and down to Dillon Beach. 
The owner was super responsive when I called her on Friday night with a question. The two downsides to the house were that the hot tub was not clean and therefore not usable. I did not alert the owner to this while we were there, so I essentially gave her no way to right this. The other item was that while the house was clean, the kitchen dishes/prep bowls/pans were dirty. We had to wash most everything before use."

Pool was super dirty. None of the outside stuff worked-patio fridge/ice maker. The umbrella shown in the photos wasn’t there because of previous renters, that wasn’t communicated so after we asked they dropped off one from Walmart. Patio furniture beat up, cushions for patio furniture was all ripped, stuff hanging out and needs to be replaced. No cleaning products or laundry soap on site as the listing reads. No S&P or seasonings, no garbage bags, no full size dinner plates. No mixing/salad bowls. No hot water in the main shower with the tub. No filter in fridge water. All the cheap kitchen pans, burn your food and leave a bad taste on them. The gas stove oven, doesn’t work properly (over an hr for a cheap 20 min pizza to cook and still wasn’t done) along with a terrible gas smell. We had to buy a broom just to clean a little. The kitchen sink leaks. No pool lights as shown. The beds weren’t great. The towels weren’t plush-they’re cheap. Bathrooms were dirty, no conditioner-and it does state shampoo and soap, but that’s it. Closet doors missing in rooms. I could go on and on. I’m not a rich, bougie person. I camp and don’t mind working with very little, but this place isn’t what is sold to you. It’s very cheaply put together with bare minimum, mismatched thrown together stuff, sold as something far different… I’ve stayed in a lot of places, I wouldn’t stay here again, especially for the money. Very disappointed we flew in from across the country for that. Sucks to work hard for a family vacation, have your hopes up and be so swiftly let down. 
Now, I will say, after we contacted them, they did have them come out right away and clean the pool some, and as I stated, they dropped off a Walmart umbrella. So that was nice. But there just isn’t any effort or extras and it definitely shows. They’re making bank and not putting in anything to make the stay nice for guests from out of state."

It is spotless, beautifully decorated, furnished with everything you could possibly need and in a nice location. The condo was a perfect size for 4 adults. The slight ocean view was a sliver above the palms trees but the mountain view was beautiful. Dining on the patio was a nice option. The screens were restricted from use and mosquitoes were coming in so we had to be sure to close the doors at night
That being said, the building itself and property were a bit of a let down. The check in process was confusing. The valet informed us that the elevator on our side of the building was not operational (it never was fixed all week) so we needed to use the fire stairs which we did to avoid an extremely long walk to another elevator. The cranes erected across from our building were an obstruction to the view and work started every morning at 8. The pools were on the murky side and not very desirable for swimming. The amount of people reserving pool chairs with their belongings made finding a chair to use next to impossible. Signs warn that this isn’t allowed but I never saw any enforcement. The store on the first floor had a lot of items but the freezer was also broken all week so items like pizzas, ice cream and other frozen products were unavailable. Parking in the garage was almost always full after 6 pm (according to valet) so we opted to park in an open lot that was a short walk to our building. The towel lending process of scanning towels in and out worked fine. The food served around the property from Dukes was a plus. The staff at the recreational rental booth was great. When a group of 10 or more staying a few units down began smoking continuously on their balcony each day we informed the valet who said she would notify security and that was quickly rectified. We truly felt that the unit was way nicer than the building and the property. I would assume this is hard for the owner of the unit who may have little or no control over the general running of the building. Don’t go expecting a resort. This is a very beautiful condo in an ok building. It appears that the cranes will be around for a while since they are painting all of the balconies and buildings exteriors. It will look great when it’s done but if we had known in advance we would have chosen a different unit to avoid this. Luggage carts are available but only for use by bellman who were not available so be prepared to handle bags yourself."

A beautiful house with ample space for eating together and lounging around the pool. We really appreciated the very large ensuite bathrooms in every room, as well as one in the main area. Great pool. Stunning views of whales, sunrises, and sunsets! 

Cons:
The surrounding neighborhood has a number of derelict buildings and has a run down feeling.

On arrival, the pool was full of green slime. However, it was cleaned by the next day.
The kitchen is very outdated, small and in disrepair. It is quite grimy and there are ants everywhere. Microwave not functioning properly. The fridge shelf fell off and broke when the door was opened. Although the fridge is old, the owner expected we would pay for the entire cost of a new shelf. We settled for paying 50%.

We had arranged with Ana-Laura to have some dinners prepared for us by a local couple. The arrangement was that we would pay them 700 pesos plus costs for groceries. Unfortunately they would never give us receipts and grossly overcharged us… the groceries would have cost less than ⅓ what they asked for. Ana-Laura didn’t seem to care or attempt to make amends.

There was no hot water in two of the four bathrooms during the whole length of our stay as one of the two propane tanks was empty. So half of our group never had hot water.

The pillows were very uncomfortable. This accommodation is in great need of updating and thorough cleaning. One expects a certain level when paying such a high price per night."

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away

There are really only a few suggesting I would make, but important ones. I usually share these directly with the owner and leave it off the reviews but I received no response to my feedback, so rather than risk the next person having problems, I’ll list on here.

1. No snow shovels. It snowed 3-4 feet during out stay and although there was a plow, it doesn’t get up to the vehicle. Bring one if you have one.
2. Fancy espresso machine and a keurig, but no standard coffee pot. Also, no keurig inserts. I brought grinds but ended up drinking cappuccinos the entire time when I just wanted to have my normal cup of coffee.

ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

All-in-all it was a disappointing stay."

There were also broken window panes, cracked tiles, warped floors, peeling paint, etc. We did not have water in one of the bathrooms, one shower did not work properly and we had some electrical issues as well as a dirty pool. In short, the house did not appear as nice as it did in the listing. The first 24 hours were pretty much a disaster since we were on the phone with the property management team and VRBO all evening as well as hosting a maintenance man, cleaning crew and plumber that evening and the next day. Not a great start to our week! We were disappointed to say the least. Once the repairs were made, the week improved. Aruba is beautiful and we enjoyed the island immensely. The house was a good size for our needs (8 adults) but definitely needs some serious TLC and the rental rate should be adjusted accordingly. It is listed as 5 beds/4 baths but the 4th bath is really tiny and poorly constructed which does not allow the water to drain well. This was the most expensive rental we've booked through VRBO and the least nice accommodations."

The outside is over grown with weeds and garbage piled up on the side of the house. I picked this one because I wanted to have a pool and a hot tub. Well hot tub was empty, so I called and they said to fill it with garden hose, and it heats pretty fast. I did and then it took two days to heat up. I asked what was wrong and they sent me directions, and I googled how to fix it as well. So I got to use it once. And the pool was lil too dirty for me. The pool people walked into back yard 2x without warning as I was laying out. The fridge/freezer was leaking on the ground. So all in all I won’t stay there again."

We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place. Some of the sheets/comforters were clearly stained with makeup and crusty with what looked like bodily fluids on them... Surely a health and safety concern. The lock on the large TV room door was broken and did not lock. The master bathroom had what looked like puke on the walls. 

Unfortunately, our stay was during record low temperatures, so we had to wear multiple layers of clothing and start a fire to stay warm, however, the damp wood and half-functioning flue caused smoke to fill the home. The downstairs basement bedroom was incredibly cold, with temperatures barely exceeding 55 degrees. Many bedrooms did not have proper window coverings. 
The high foot-traffic areas were also dangerously icy and there was champagne (or some other substance) sprayed on the ceiling in the living room. The dishes in the cabinets were still dirty with lipstick on them and the carpets throughout the house were stained with suspicious-looking fluids, all of which are health and safety concerns. 
I relayed this list of issues to Vacasa and they did compensate us with 10% back from the price of our stay. This is why I am (generously) awarding 3 stars..."

It's a quiet spot with a beautiful view and access to the water.
The photos and description are misleading. There are not 2 sets of bunk beds. There is one. Thinking each kid would have a bed to sleep on was wrong. Someone had to sleep on the couch! Very frustrating.
Second, there was not a play toy in the yard. There was nothing.
The hot tub was dirty and there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher. Ewww
Despite all of that it's a beautiful property."
