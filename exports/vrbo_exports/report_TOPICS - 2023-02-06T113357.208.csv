The apartment was great for two people. Any more then two-three people and you will feel crowed. The apartment was clean but we did find vomit in the hallway right outside out door.

Check in process was a bit confusing at first, lucky I travel for work a lot and was able to figure out the elevator/door codes and where to go. The parking garage was confusing at first but were able to figure that all out. It was very difficult to exit the garage at night due to the valet from a restaurant blocking most the exit. 

But that elevator.. We would enter the code and would start moving to our floor then the door would not open and would send us back down to whichever floor had just hit the elevator button. It happened three separate times to the point we stopped using the elevator for fear it would trap us in. 

I have been to Nashville for many weekend trips and will keep this location in mind for the next trip."

This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.
A couple of hours later, she and another gal showed up with a new tv. They did not know how to hook it up and called a third gal from the office who came over when she could get away. She got the new tv working. I did not ask for any refund but I did ask the manager during that time if THEY offered any rebates to partially compensate for a trip as full of annoyances as this one. I just made the point that I had spent over $6000 to fly to Marco to rest and the 8 days had been anything but restful. She replied that none of this was anyone’s fault and she’d have to ask the owner about any rebate. I said thank you, please do that. As she left my unit, I reiterated, please let me know what the owner says and she said she would. I never heard another word from her.
She did also tell me that they couldn’t haul the old tv off and she would leave it and the box trash on our front porch for someone to come get. When we left 5 days later, all that trash was still setting there.

During the next 5 days, I was briefly stuck on the small elevator that goes to the upper private parking level. No call button on that elevator worked. We parked our car on the lower level and used the main elevator or the stairs. On the last day, packing to leave, we had suitcases and boxes and bags to ferry from the 4th floor to the first floor parking garage. This time my friend got stuck on the main elevator which then quit working completely. He escaped and called the Esplanade management company number posted on the elevator. That guy sounded unconcerned, yeah, we’ve been having some elevator trouble, I’ll call Otis again, blah, blah, blah. Don’t you think you should put a sign on the elevator so people will know, we asked. Oh, I’ll just cut off the circuit breaker when I get a chance to get over there, he said. (Sure hope no one was on it.) And we’re not kids but we could climb up and down 8 flights of stairs; everyone may not be able to do that.

Summary: Did we enjoy our visit? Yes of course because we don’t let stuff steal our joy and I do think our unit property folks tried at times and I also know stuff happens. But I’ve stayed at Esplanade twice before in two different units in the past few years. I loved the first two visits and can recall only experiencing one issue which was resolved satisfactorily in 10 minutes. The property is still beautiful, the restaurants are great, and the view is just stunning.
But I spent way too much money and time this trip to be wrangling problems I can face at home for free."

The property is amazing and it was truly a pleasure being able to enjoy the property and 30A-Vacations outstanding service. When I originally booked the place it had a lot of availability, I imagined because it’s new. Agreeing seeing everything, I know that’s the case! I’ve got no doubt that this’ll be one that fills up quickly in the future! My family and I will be on it! Three things to note:

1) If you get stuck between floors in the elevator outside of business hours, try all possible fix actions first. Then call the fire department. That emergency number that’s given to you is not a 24 hour emergency line.

2) If you want hot tub / pool heating access during your stay, communicate that ahead of time.(At least 3 days) I missed that memo and in turn missed out on the hot fun. :(

3) Have a blast!

Thanks again 30A

We’ll see you soon!"

The proximity to the main strip in Gatlinburg is great. The building, though, is run down. One main reason I booked this room was because it had an indoor pool for my kids, but the pool was closed. However, there were about 10 young adults/teens partying in the pool area around 10 pm...drinking & smoking pot, which could be smelled in the room. The elevator didn't work properly...my husband & son were stuck when trying to check out with our luggage on a luggage cart. The bathtubs looked dingy & every sink/tub seemed clogged (wouldn't properly drain). The beds were rock hard. The tvs were a pain to try & figure out (multiple remotes, some without batteries) & no instructions. I was leery of using the towels because they didn't smell clean/looked dingy. There was accumulated dust on fixtures feom the ceiling. The parking area is very small & the spaces are too narrow. My son has special needs & we have a hanicapped tag for him...there were yound adults outside messing around & parked in a handicapped spot without a handicapped placard or tag. With no office or officials there, we had no way to have any of our issues handled. All in all, it was truly an awful experience & this place is not for people seeking a nice family trip."
