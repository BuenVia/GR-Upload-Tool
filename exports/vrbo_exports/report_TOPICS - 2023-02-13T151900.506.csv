Carpet had been vacuumed and sinks and toilets were clean but the place badly needs a deep clean. Walls and baseboards and window ledges were filthy. The mini blinds in the “kids” room (bunk bed room) were all broken so the kids were up with the sun. The floors are entirely splitting and coming up in several areas, a real trip hazard for a toddler or elderly. The furniture was equally beat up, the chair in the living room looked like it was rescued from a curb. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen. Sponges were scary dirty, thankfully we brought our own of all of these things…washed every dish before we used it, especially the utensils, because the drawers were so gross inside. The lights over the dining room table didn’t work and the remote control lights for the other rooms were wonky, my daughter was trying to turn hers on and it turned mine off. As for the pros: good location, we felt safe, good size yard to play in and plenty of space for a family or two. We enjoyed the sleds they provided. I really liked the cubbies in the kitchen and all the rooms. Check in was easy and host was communicative. The place has potential but really needs some attention. I understand new flooring is expensive but at minimum the place needs a deep cleaning and new blinds in the one room, and that would cost less than we paid for our stay so I just don’t understand why it’s not been done."

The kitchen is well stocked with every utensil you could possibly need and the bathrooms are modern. TVs in all bedrooms and other living areas. Games and puzzles for the kids downstairs were a bonus. 

We stayed as a family with 4 children aged 5-11. The house is jam packed with hunting stuff and sharp woodworking tools which may be hazardous for inquisitive children. Although there is a wood burning stove in the living room this was not available to guests due to insurance. This was disappointing as we were hoping to do s’mores with the kids. That said there is a fire pit (of sorts) in the back yard. 

The outside area requires a lot of work and is obviously undergoing landscaping. Unfortunately, tools required for this were scattered around the yard and this could be dangerous for kids. However, there was plenty of other space for them to run around and once the yard is finished it will be great."

We were empathetic towards this so helped where we could. Once we had finally all settled in, she knocked and came through the house two or three times looking for them and we had to move our cars several times as they went in and out. She then left her phone in the house and all throughout the evening until 11:30pm it rang on and off waking us and our children several times until we could finally locate it and discovered whose phone it was! Our first day felt like an absolute shambles because of all this and we didn’t get to properly relax at all. We then had crappy intermittently working internet the whole trip despite us saying we relied on the internet overnight (medical reason) Cheryl’s communication around this was rubbish until the final morning when she decided to call spark and by then it was too late. And no, DVDs on offer did not fix the issue we had overnight. The kayaks are decrepit and not safe for young kids to be on so don’t bother there. And to top off our holiday, despite us being SO patient and kind towards Cheryl the entire trip, she then accuses us off breaking a wheel on a trundler we didn’t even use and is charging us an extra $845 because of this and due to sand in the house and some fingerprints on the sliding door and the couch.. We were at a BEACH house with 4 young kids - come on! I grew up with a parent who was a cleaner, that parent was staying with us. We left that house cleaner than most would have, even wiping out her fridge and only left the vacuuming and linen washing for the cleaner. There are NO instructions that say any trace of sand is banned in the beach house, I rinsed off all their togs in the sink next to the washing machine, as anyone would but I’m not the perfect mum. It’s impossible for some sand not to escape me, I did my best but to charge us over $800 for sand and fingerprints is UNREASONABLE. I saw her previous review where she accused other guests of water damage and nearly didn’t book because of it but figured it was isolated and surely we’d be all good but it seems like this is just the way the owner is, she was so angry about the fact she was out of pocket for losing her keys and so she’s now clutching at straws trying to recoup some of that loss by charging us for ridiculous things. We will not be paying for this and are just grateful to have a lawyer in our family to sort her out."

With a 2 year old who doesn't keep clothes or blankets on I need a warm house. With the thermostat that has settings set to go back to 56 every 2 hours it was a rough couple of nights for us. Cold family and cold and fussy baby was not fun. Heat does turn yes, but settings don't allow it to stay the temp to keep warm. Its like fighting with the thermostat all night. Hopefully owner can get settings changed so no one else has an uncomfortable stay. Also does have pellet stove and a tiny space heater in closet but don't feel safe with small children leaving these things on at night. Heat from heater would have been best for us."

It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child."

The pictures don't do it justice. The house is even nicer in person than it appears. The island is easy to get to (assuming you have a boat). The views were unbelievable. We had drinks by the platform watching sunset every night. Our young kids could run around and play without any concerns for their safety. The cove is very protected and was a lot of fun to relax and swim off of the dock. The house was well supplied. And the hosts were fantastic. Day or night, they were available and gave us a ton of suggestions on places to visit and things to do. We had a vacation that helped us create memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. We'll definitely be back again. The only heads up that I will give (which is no fault of the hosts) is that the lake can be a little difficult to navigate if its your first time. This was my first time on the lake and I was a little nervous trying to find my way around. By the end of the week, I got the hang of it, but it took a full week before I got comfortable so make sure that you are confident in your boat driving and navigation skills."

There were exactly 4 cups, 4 forks, 4 spoons, 4 towels, no washcloth, no corkscrew, no napkins etc. Although the pool was listed as heated, it clearly was not.

Great fireplace and views of the mountain. Living room area and kitchen were the best part of the house. Although not much couch space to sit if you are going with a larger groups of people. Management of Stowe country homes was good and very responsive to lack of heat we experienced they sent over HVAC right away to address it. 

Cons: House needs EXTREME updating. I have rented MANY houses and this is by far the worst one and first bad review I have ever left. The upstairs “suite” has a bathroom that looks like it’s from the 70’s, with a terrible size shower and water pressure. It was absolutely FREEZING in the bathroom as well. Advertised as a queen size bed but very I comfortable for my husband and I to both sleep in felt more and looked more like a double. Staying on walls in bathrooms and on doors. Beware if you have small children there’s a window like shutter in the bedroom that you can easily be a hazard as the ledge for it is low. The house I also advertised in the description as a 3 bedroom meanwhile on of the bedrooms has a sofa with a pullout. Old blinds that are yellow in color. Old tile flooring in the 2 bedrooms on the main floor. Cracks on the walls. The basement is completely unfinished with old worn leather couch and old cushion couches. Concrete floor, Would not want to spend anytime hanging out down there in that kind of condition. Overall this house really needs to be updated and furnishing replenished before being rented out. My husband and I really did not sleep well because of the lack of space and comfortability for us to sleep."

The space worked well for us (3 adults + 1 child). The TVs have been updated to HD flat screens. Deck reconstruction is work-in-progress. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with high winds pushing fireplace smoke into the unit. If I came back again, I would find a different unit in Mountain Lodge without a fireplace.

More about the smell… For the first two days, there was an overwhelming, strong, unpleasant smell of fireplace smoke throughout the entire unit. The smell hit you like a wall of upon walking in the door. It made our eyes water. The smoke would be hazardous to an infant or asthmatic. There is no central HVAC (only radiant heat) so the only option to “air it out” was to open the exterior door/windows to sub-freezing high winds. We emailed the owners and they had no meaningful solutions. The building manager eventually came and she explained the wind-chimney phenomena. The phenomena is exacerbated if the units above/below use their fireplaces, which share a common chimney. The third day, mercifully, the wind died down outside and so did the smell. Our clothes stunk when we got home. It would be helpful for the owners to provide air purifiers w/HEPA filters. It smelled like we were living in a chimney.

The unit’s location in ML makes the sound from the common area of the lobby really carry into the bedrooms. If you are sensitive to noise when sleeping, find a different unit."

First the good. The property itself is very nice. It has everything you need: towels, linens, spices in the kitchen, and a hot-tub. Location is about 10 minutes from Vail Village.

Now the bad. The issue my group ran into was the property management company (Vacasa) is terrible. When we arrived at the house there was a deceased mouse caught in a mousetrap on the living room floor next to the couch. I looked under the couch and saw two additional set mousetraps which were near the edge of the couch. If you have children that is a huge hazard considering later in the trip I accidentally stepped on one. We also observed and photographed mice feces under the master bedroom bed. I contacted Vacasa immediately and made them aware of the situation and was told that a cleaner would come out immediately. A cleaner never showed so we discarded the mouse ourselves and I called Vacasa again the next day to ask for cleaning stuff to be sent out. They apologized for the inconvenience and again said a cleaner would be out shortly. Hours went by so I called again and requested to speak with a manager. The manager said a cleaner would be out shortly, but never showed. I continuously contacted Vacasa for three days until they finally sent out a cleaner to take care of the mice feces. It took literally 3 days to get someoen to clean up the feces. 

Received a $500 refund on a $3200 + trip."

However the state of the property is not as it is portrayed. There were lights out in every room, door handles did not work properly, furniture is very tired looking and uncomfortable, the pool table is ripped and looks dreadful, just to name a few things. Another thing is that it is not child friendly/safe at all as it only has star pickets and rope as a fence with a 2 metre or more drop. It would be good if these things could be rectified moving forward so that others can have a better experience. Regards Helen"
