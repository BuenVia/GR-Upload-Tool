Carpet had been vacuumed and sinks and toilets were clean but the place badly needs a deep clean. Walls and baseboards and window ledges were filthy. The mini blinds in the “kids” room (bunk bed room) were all broken so the kids were up with the sun. The floors are entirely splitting and coming up in several areas, a real trip hazard for a toddler or elderly. The furniture was equally beat up, the chair in the living room looked like it was rescued from a curb. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen. Sponges were scary dirty, thankfully we brought our own of all of these things…washed every dish before we used it, especially the utensils, because the drawers were so gross inside. The lights over the dining room table didn’t work and the remote control lights for the other rooms were wonky, my daughter was trying to turn hers on and it turned mine off. As for the pros: good location, we felt safe, good size yard to play in and plenty of space for a family or two. We enjoyed the sleds they provided. I really liked the cubbies in the kitchen and all the rooms. Check in was easy and host was communicative. The place has potential but really needs some attention. I understand new flooring is expensive but at minimum the place needs a deep cleaning and new blinds in the one room, and that would cost less than we paid for our stay so I just don’t understand why it’s not been done."

The kitchen is well stocked with every utensil you could possibly need and the bathrooms are modern. TVs in all bedrooms and other living areas. Games and puzzles for the kids downstairs were a bonus. 

We stayed as a family with 4 children aged 5-11. The house is jam packed with hunting stuff and sharp woodworking tools which may be hazardous for inquisitive children. Although there is a wood burning stove in the living room this was not available to guests due to insurance. This was disappointing as we were hoping to do s’mores with the kids. That said there is a fire pit (of sorts) in the back yard. 

The outside area requires a lot of work and is obviously undergoing landscaping. Unfortunately, tools required for this were scattered around the yard and this could be dangerous for kids. However, there was plenty of other space for them to run around and once the yard is finished it will be great."

The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool."

Host finally messaged he will refund but still havent gotten the money back in 1 month. I am out almost $1000. Vrbo customer service is non existent too. Left a complaint with no response yet. The property is a metal container that has been converted. There is no bathroom to wash, only a very dirty porta potty! The listing is inaccurate. Stay away!! Will give negative 5 stars. Waste of money. I plan to stay away from VRBO. We book cabins every few months - this has been the worst experience in years."

Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing."

We were empathetic towards this so helped where we could. Once we had finally all settled in, she knocked and came through the house two or three times looking for them and we had to move our cars several times as they went in and out. She then left her phone in the house and all throughout the evening until 11:30pm it rang on and off waking us and our children several times until we could finally locate it and discovered whose phone it was! Our first day felt like an absolute shambles because of all this and we didn’t get to properly relax at all. We then had crappy intermittently working internet the whole trip despite us saying we relied on the internet overnight (medical reason) Cheryl’s communication around this was rubbish until the final morning when she decided to call spark and by then it was too late. And no, DVDs on offer did not fix the issue we had overnight. The kayaks are decrepit and not safe for young kids to be on so don’t bother there. And to top off our holiday, despite us being SO patient and kind towards Cheryl the entire trip, she then accuses us off breaking a wheel on a trundler we didn’t even use and is charging us an extra $845 because of this and due to sand in the house and some fingerprints on the sliding door and the couch.. We were at a BEACH house with 4 young kids - come on! I grew up with a parent who was a cleaner, that parent was staying with us. We left that house cleaner than most would have, even wiping out her fridge and only left the vacuuming and linen washing for the cleaner. There are NO instructions that say any trace of sand is banned in the beach house, I rinsed off all their togs in the sink next to the washing machine, as anyone would but I’m not the perfect mum. It’s impossible for some sand not to escape me, I did my best but to charge us over $800 for sand and fingerprints is UNREASONABLE. I saw her previous review where she accused other guests of water damage and nearly didn’t book because of it but figured it was isolated and surely we’d be all good but it seems like this is just the way the owner is, she was so angry about the fact she was out of pocket for losing her keys and so she’s now clutching at straws trying to recoup some of that loss by charging us for ridiculous things. We will not be paying for this and are just grateful to have a lawyer in our family to sort her out."

Being able to spend as much time as possible outside is important for a family. We used the bar b que and found only 2 burners worked. 
One of the bedrooms had not been cleaned properly when we arrived and there was glass on the floor in the childrens room causing an injury luckily to an adult not one of the children.

It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child."

We were expecting the area to be up and coming based on the information in the posting, but it was still in what seemed to be a pretty rough area (we observed multiple police cars and ambulance stop in the neighborhood throughout the weekend and watched a neighbor get arrested as we first checked in). The only issue with the house itself was there was no wine opener (which was an easy fix!) and the toilet became clogged. Everything else was as advertised in the posting and the host was very responsive/ easy to work with. 

Perhaps if it’s all adults staying at the property then the location might not matter as much, but we didn’t feel particularly safe at this property (particularly because we were traveling with children)."

The views were spectacular! The cabin is secluded, but yet close enough to town to enjoy all the sights, shopping and activities. The cabin is welcoming and has plenty of room for families to enjoy and not feel crowded. We were also thrilled to find such an incredible cabin that welcomed our little pup as well! 
One bit of advice to those with smaller children, the steps leading down to the bottom (game room) floor are very steep. Make sure to be careful and assist any younger children going up and down. We had no issues (my youngest is 16 yrs old), but little ones may need an extra hand just to be on the safe side 😊 

The beds are very comfortable and the back deck was my favorite spot to relax (minus the cold weather LOL). We have already recommended it to some of our family and friends and plan to return again ourselves in the future. The hosts were extremely friendly, responsive and made check in and check out very easy! Thank you again for sharing your slice of Heaven with our family!

Check in was simple. The condo was spacious. The views are nice. Unfortunately they have closed the skiing down on this side of the resort. So there is NO Ski-in/Ski-out access.

There was an awful lot of previous water damage, and it appears that nothing has been maintained or updated, ever.

The upstairs bedroom is lacking a window and is unsafe for children. The railing at the top of the stairs overlooking the loft has a broken plastic netting to help keep children from climbing through the spindles and over the edge. This needs to be replaced.

The condo was sufficient for our stay, but pretty disappointed about the overall accommodations. The floors were dirty, and we mopped everything. There were obvious spills (soda/juice) in the kitchen that were present when we arrived. The television in the main bedroom does not work.

In its original shape I am sure this was a fantastic place. It could be very nice again with a few updates."

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean"

By the end of the week, I got the hang of it, but it took a full week before I got comfortable so make sure that you are confident in your boat driving and navigation skills."

The size was perfect for my husband and I and the views were beautiful. The HUGE drawback was the shower and the cleanliness. The shower floor looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages and there was a crack in the floor fiberglass that looked like an unsuccessful repair was made. Depending on how long it’s been like this, I’d imagine the floor beneath is compromised and a major safety concern. The cabin is in desperate need of a deep cleaning. General floor areas were clean, but there was at least a quarter inch of dust on all baseboards and some fixtures. The stove burners had cooking debris that seemed to have been there awhile. The cabin has glass covers protecting the coffee tables that were disgusting underneath and on top. They are a safety concern if you bring any children because they don’t have sticky pads to hold them in place so they slide with the slightest bump. Bathroom mirrors looked like someone had taken a wet rag to clean them. 

Positive notes: Great location to all activities. The drive to the cabin is a little intense with steep inclines, but one you drive it a time or two, you get use to it. All linens were clean. We didn’t use the whirlpool tub due to not trusting the cleanliness, but we sure enjoyed the hot tub since we knew there were chemicals in it for disinfection. The cover for the hot tub isn’t the prettiest, but serves its purpose. We had a lot of fun with the pool table and retro arcade games. Gas grill worked, but had a little trouble with the ignition here and there. I’d recommend bringing a long lighter or matches in case it’s being temperamental during your visit. Also bring a dustpan/sweeper because there’s no cleaning supplies in the cabin. 

Would we stay there again? Not sure. Cabin size and amenities were perfect, but the property management that takes care of the cabin, Aunt Bugs rentals, seem to have the same bad reviews with their other cabins they rent out. I’d probably find another cabin that I wouldn’t feel the need to clean on vacation."

Having small children with us made this dangerous and kept us from enjoying the lanai. When asked about the credit, Remax refused, and when I pushed back, received no response as to why. Also know that Remax will take a security deposit that is as much as a weeks rental and hold it for nearly two months. I did accept these terms, so caveat emptor.

The space worked well for us (3 adults + 1 child). The TVs have been updated to HD flat screens. Deck reconstruction is work-in-progress. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with high winds pushing fireplace smoke into the unit. If I came back again, I would find a different unit in Mountain Lodge without a fireplace.

More about the smell… For the first two days, there was an overwhelming, strong, unpleasant smell of fireplace smoke throughout the entire unit. The smell hit you like a wall of upon walking in the door. It made our eyes water. The smoke would be hazardous to an infant or asthmatic. There is no central HVAC (only radiant heat) so the only option to “air it out” was to open the exterior door/windows to sub-freezing high winds. We emailed the owners and they had no meaningful solutions. The building manager eventually came and she explained the wind-chimney phenomena. The phenomena is exacerbated if the units above/below use their fireplaces, which share a common chimney. The third day, mercifully, the wind died down outside and so did the smell. Our clothes stunk when we got home. It would be helpful for the owners to provide air purifiers w/HEPA filters. It smelled like we were living in a chimney.

The unit’s location in ML makes the sound from the common area of the lobby really carry into the bedrooms. If you are sensitive to noise when sleeping, find a different unit."

1) Jeffery, the online assistant on Vrbo was great at responding my questions when I had to reach out reg this rental. 
2) The house had a fenced in backyard, 4 small rooms, tile or vinyl floors, clean bathrooms and beds. 
3) Despite the fact that when you lookup the address on google maps, the first thing you see is several police cars and armed officers fully crashing on the house across the street… the neighborhood was quite and pleasing in person; only heard 9 gunshots coming from a house nearby, the night before we left. Side note, it was NOT on 4th of July or New Year’s, in case you wonder. 

Now, the negatives:
1) We did not receive any communication, confirmation email, property address or check-in instruction till WE reached out the night before taking off to this destination. We first tried calling the phone number provided but nobody answered and the VM was full. Then we finally got in contact with Jeff through Vrbo’s website to provide us with the info. 
2) The floors of the house were covered in a dark dust, as if you walked into an open-door restaurant in Manhattan, that stained everything that came in contact, from my dog’s paws to our luggage and anything else in between. The rugs and runners around the house were, as expected, also stained with this dark debris (or just dirty, it didn’t stop to check). I also found some sort of large bed cover inside the washer machine that smelled like cat urine (and No laundry detergent anywhere in the house). 
3) Cockroach – there were several juvenile live roaches found crawling around the bathtubs, laundry room, inside the dishwasher! We had to sleep with all the lights on to try to avoid waking up with roaches on the bed. To their defense, there were cracks between the ceilings and the walls, all around the house; understandably hard to keep pests out. 
4) The backyard did not have a volleyball net, but only a deflated ball around the bushes. There were pieces of glass and other debris that made the yard unsuitable/unsafe to let your pet (or other children) loose. Multiple areas with dog feces around the yard from previous residents. Only 1 garbage bag, no replacement bags, which did not help... 
5) Lastly, the guest bathroom had a small leak coming from the back of the toilet, that we noted only after we tried to flush the toilet. Needless to say, we had to close the outlet valve leading to the tank and mark that bathroom out-of-order."

In addition, we had small children and my mother who is older staying with us we were concerned there was a missing spindle from upstairs where kids discovered and became a hazard for entire stay as well as not having a handrail on steps. I wish it was disclosed as not suitable for children under 7 as other properties do. The “4th bedroom” was a bed in the open loft area no privacy and finally the cleanliness was very disappointing, very dusty floors carpets not vacuumed with dead flies on them sticky handles etc sinks and toilets not properly disinfecting among other issues"

We had 6 adults, 2 children and a 9 month old. We had plenty of room. Property was beautiful. House does need a little TLC. There are multiple things broken or not working properly. It did not bother us though as we spent most of our time out or hanging at the club house. We had a lot of issues with the clubhouse picking up our trash (partly because of the holidays and partly because of laziness) I did notify the property manager as well as club house manager during our stay. We arrived Christmas Eve to trash overflowing the front box from previous tenants. This caused animals to dig through the trash that evening and we woke up to a huge mess that we had to clean up (someone else's garbage). Had to contact office to pick up trash on 3 separate occasions because they were not coming daily like they were supposed to. 

Some things that need attention in the house: microwave vent cover being held together with twisty ties, couches are super broken in (you need to sit on a pillow so you don't fall in), comforters on bed were extremely dirty and stained (we immediately stripped them off the beds and did not use them), beds are very low to the ground (did not bother us but was difficult for our parents getting in and out of bed) shower head seals broken in master bed room so you can't use one of the shower heads, handle in master bath broken in shower, master bedroom lamp broken, TV in master could not load any channels, and towels dirty upon arrival (which we had to wash prior to using), pool light did not be turn on and we had small ants in the upstairs bathrooms. Even with all that being said, we had a fabulous time and would stay here again. 

The property manager was great. She was quick to respond and went above and beyond by decorating for Christmas and setting up a tree for us (at my request). 

The clubhouse was fun and had a great little new years eve party by the pool that our family enjoyed. You do need to purchase your own key card for $20 if you don't want to wait in the line to get in the property. Sometimes the line was very long and depending on who was working would take much longer. Some requested to see your confirmation emails with your booking while other required your photo ID, some took time to write all your info down while others did not. We found it easier to just purchase the nonrefundable card after a couple of days waiting in the line. Everyone at the front gate was extremely friendly."
