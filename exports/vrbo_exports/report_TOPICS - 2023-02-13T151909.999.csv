I don’t even know where to start. How about the sheets on the bed had dried blood/mucus on them? Dried blood was also smeared on the wall of the downstairs bathroom. There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but it wasn’t. Maybe I’m gonna be a hotel person from now on."

It really served us well. Unfortunately it was not clean upon arrival. After a long drive to Napier, we vacuumed the very dusty floors and a very dusty (and stained) couch with a lot of debri under the cushions. Also, the kitchen floor was really dirty. We tried to find a mop and the only mop had a spare new mophead in the laundry, but it didn't fit. Also, there was no spray and wipe. So we bought a new mophead and a refil bottle of spray and wipe that we used while there and left the rest behind. It was nice to see the place was environmentally friendly with their supplied products. I took the liberty to remove a net curtain in the front bedroom with black mould on it and left it in the laundry. The lights in the lounge flickered a lot and the bulb was dead in the dining room. As they are large bulbs, I wasn't sure where to get a replacement. There was chewing gum stuck on the door handle in the kitchen and mouse poo under the kitchen window squab. So, we did a bit of a spring clean and then we felt great. Nice pottery in the cupboards, that we admired while there. To be fair it is a really great place to stay and we loved being there. Nice and airy and light. There was a sticker on the toilet roll when we arrived that said Gem Cleaning Services, so it may be that the property manager needs to give them some feedback."

I asked for a refund and stayed at a hotel because of the health risk. They told me I would get a refund, but still have not received it.

Single use amenities only, no pantry staples (oil, spices, condiments, basic flour/sugar) no coffee pods for the Kurig the only way to make coffee unless you bring your own appliance and beans. Bring everything. We located wood for the fire behind the garage as we were only given 2 logs and 8 pieces of kindling, upon asking the property manager, we were informed we should go purchase some (from where?!). The home was not very clean at arrival, including the front walk covered in snow and ice, dirty foyer, mouse droppings in drawers, living room rug full of crumbs. We found a vacuum to use, and it was clogged and not picking anything up took it apart cleaned out the clog and vacuumed the main floor. Advertised Netflix is false, the TV's are for appearance as they are not Smart nor do they have a streaming service connection or cable/dish and the internet spent most of the time trying to connect. My daughter was unable to participate in her semester wrap-up because she could not stay connected with her school Chromebook. 

The beds were comfortable, and the linens were abundant."

No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds. We would have turned around on our first day if we could get a refund!
