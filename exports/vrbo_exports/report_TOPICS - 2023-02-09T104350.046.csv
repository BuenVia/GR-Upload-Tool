The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!"
