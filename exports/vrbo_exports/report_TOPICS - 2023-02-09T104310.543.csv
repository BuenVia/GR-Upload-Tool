Super clean, comfy bed, well decorated and stocked. Greeted with a welcome note and bottle of wine! Only two things I would give feedback on - there isn’t an iron - not a deal breaker by any means but just so happened I needed one this trip. Also, lots of ice in the parking area - would have been great to have it salted as it was VERY slippery to walk on. But I’ll definitely stay here again. Lovely rental!!!"

Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle
Les 2 lits de l'alcôve sont HS.
Les serviettes de toilette mériteraient d’être renouvelées.
Il faudrait rajouter une glace (par exemple entre Wc et Sd’eau où l’on puisse se voir en entier
1 coup de peinture sur les murs serait la touche finale pour un appartement quasi parfait."

You are paying for location, not quality of accommodations. Of note, this is unit #9 in the condo block. This is not listed in the check-in details and you will be left wandering around peering in windows trying to find the art that matches the listing photos until the manager calls you back. The only hint we got that we were in unit 9 was the name of the wifi network. 

There were three main issues with this property. 
1. The garage door was broken and we had to manage a service call while we were there (they fixed it in a haphazard way that required a light switch to be on in order to operate the door)
2. The dryer was broken. We were instructed that the dry mountain air is great for hang-drying. Fine, but for a week and 6 people we just had laundry hanging everywhere the entire time.  3. The management company said they had a cable person coming for a routine service, but asked us if we’d like to decline the visit. We said we’d like to decline and went on with our ski day. Later in the day I find out my mom was in the bathroom when a stranger let themselves into the house. After being super freaked out she learns it is the cable person. When pressed, the person said they used the code and let themselves in. In our opinion this was unacceptable and raises safety and security concerns. When we asked the management company to respond, they stopped responding to my messages and didn’t contact us again until they sent an automated check out message.

We’re reasonable renters and don’t expect perfection. We understand issues arise when you are staying in someone else’s home, but the combination of these three things (given the price of the rental) just amounted to too many problems and I was really disappointed that the management company ghosted us when I asked for a response. 

Pros:
3 minute walk to the poma t-bar. Location is excellent
Large mudroom where you can leave your skis and poles
Spacious bedrooms each with their own bathroom
Apple TV makes casting/music easy

Cons: 
Broken drier
Broken garage door
Unplowed driveway (they didn’t plow after a few snows and now it is just a compacted snow mess that is really challenging to drive over and treacherous to walk on)
Mildewy dish towels
Pots that leak (literally leak, we were boiling water and realized it was slowly seeping out the bottom)
Cat hair covering all the blankets 
Tired construction"

Really doesn't sleep as many as the website claims comfortably. We were going for a memorial service and I stated as much in the initial VRBO correspondence....but kept getting ""Enjoy your Vacation!"" emails. Email from property manager stated we need parking passes then I was told we didn't need parking passes at the office? I wanted a place where the family could gather and mourn without having to worry about insignificant things....however the tone set by the property manager's automatic emails and materials made everyone feel unwelcome and uneasy. In the beginning of the process, I chatted with a VRBO tech about the ridiculous contract and she was no help."
