It’s quiet and the noise downstairs is not unbearable like I thought it could be (the loudest was the occasional overly drunk person yelling to friends down the street - the sound of happy college kids).

What wasn’t so charming was the rest of the stay and that was solely responsible by who was in charge of the rental (not the apartment or the people). The problem was the apathetic management. 

-We had to call for check-in instructions (usually those come via email and I received them four days after our stay.
-When we arrived, I knocked on the backdoor for someone to move their car so we could park there.
- The pipes were dry emitting sewer gas smells
- The temperature in the apartment was 50 degrees because the heat was off.
- There was no CO or smoke detector (it was laying on a TV stand with the battery out.
- We had to find our own bedding in the apartment and make our own beds
- We had to call for towels (which arrived quickly the next day)
- Trash cans were unlined and we had to find the liners
- The sink was dirty with someone else's shaved whiskers
- The ""goodies"" in the fridge didn't seem safe to eat based on how else everything was 'forgotten' about

It left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I'll eat or sleep there again. Management said they'd try and make it right, but I never heard from them again."

We called the unit manager, Jessica Jimenez, who finally got back to us after 20 minutes and gave us the code to the electronic lock. The apartment looked exactly like the images, but was not maintained well. Going out to the balcony, we found a cigarette butt and moving the accent table found it was not cleaned underneath it. The primary bedroom had no closet and the second bedroom had a closet, half fitted with shelves and the other half with a tall chest of drawers leaving 8"" on hanging on either side of the chest of drawers. The kitchen cabinets were very old and dirty... seeing our first roach within minutes of arriving. Good pots and pans, but few pieces of flatware. Baths were decent, but we had to look for bath mats that were dirty, so we washed them. The washer and dryer were very good, but was concerned about the dryer filter since the screen had holes in it and lint was going into the machine..... potential fire hazard. The TV was not working and Jessica kept telling us that the remote had to be connected to the internet. After two weeks of not being able to stream, tech person Saul came to check it out and discovered that the remote was not working. Three days later he returned and hooked up a new remote and we were able to watch TV our last week. While watching TV, we discovered crumbs that had fallen between the cushions and never cleaned up. We have been using VRBO for several years and this is the first horrible experience we have had. DO NOT rent this unit."

There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

Excellent space for a family of 5. House was really clean and tidy, really well looked after (even if it looks a bit dated in parts in the photos - yes it is, but it’s fine and in really good condition). Beds, linen, pillows all fantastic, great condition and very comfortable. Pool table was fun and three TVs were great. Internet perfect. Smoke alarms went off once for no reason and another time just opening the oven. Not a big deal. Slight leak in kitchen skylight in heavy rain was a bit of pain but didn’t cause a significant problem. Would definitely stay here again. Best improvement to make would be a nice outdoor area to sit and relax outside, not particularly inviting and so we didn’t hang out the back at all. Again, not a big issue but would’ve made it that much better. Thanks for providing a nice place."

It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.

Cleanliness of the condo was definitely not the best, stuff from previous ""renters"" were still in the rooms. Lost internet for most of the stay which sucked but not much you can do about that. Smoke alarm started to beep do to low battery in the middle of the night. Very minimum things in there. Normally there is trash bags, ziploc bags, foil, salt and pepper, sugar, coffee not at this place. It literally has bare minimum in there. Bed in master is ""memory foam"" it was really hard and sheets had stains in them. Overall the only good thing for our family was the location."

It seems the expectation is that the guest will make themselves available to pack up holiday decorations that filled closets,manage housekeeping, pool maintenance,& plumbers. Issues may arise during a stay but basic maintenance should be addressed between guests - not left for the guests to address. The house was dirty- red splatters on bedroom doors, dirty toilet seat , blankets of dust on mouldings. Red food splatters on kitchen cabinet, backsplash tile and toe kick in kitchen. Scuff marks on walls, moldy caulking in shower. Washing machine was dirty and there were dirty towels in the washing machine when we arrived. Slow sink in the bathroom. 
When I told The host that I felt the cleaning service was stealing her money she became defensive and said they do a wonderful job and that she has been using them for 5 years. 
There were Missing fire alarms. Only 2 in the bedrooms. None in the rest of the house. Broken shades in den. No information about the area attractions, restaurants, grocery store, - although the host was aware that a previous guest had taken the book there was no replacement. Extension cords that are staples to wall used to plug in lamps. 
The 4th bedroom is in the ‘guest cottage’ which would have been fine for us IF it was clean, didn’t smell musty and if people staying in there were able to access the main house at night after the doors to the house were locked. The back door to the yard from the main house didn’t close correctly so they put 2 slide bolts on it. Because of this anyone staying in the guest house would have to exit the yard and walk around to the front door to unlock it with a key. The only other access would be through a bedroom which would be awkward to leave unlocked while people are sleeping in the room. 
The pool heater not on. Had to flip on circuit breaker while being directed by host and program heater-heater not working and pool needed to be shocked .
The AC compressor in the side yard next to back door has fencing around it that is in disrepair and literally fell down every day- very disappointing Major construction going on next door- had to finally leave early bc we couldn’t sit outside from noise and debris coming over the fence. Use your money elsewhere Would not recommend. Area was centrally located to all. Find another house in the same area. You’ll be much happier."

Restaurant and bar close by and the food was pretty good. Be prepared for a bit of a walk getting to the condo- the taxi dropped us off quite a distance from the unit which was unfortunate. 

The bed is soft and super comfy and the condo is equipped with just about everything you’d need to enjoy the water. 

FYI - the smoke detector is went off in the middle of the night for no reason.

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again."

The garage was just big enough for a standard SUV and that was a good thing as there are generally NOT enough ""visitor"" parking spots when you need them (at night).

Further, the shower curtain ( assoc. with the back bedroom) was disgusting....as a tremendous amount of mold had accumulated.

While it’s much appreciated that accommodation like the Raetihi bach is available at low cost, and a more basic standard is expected for the price, there were a few issues. The bach was quite dirty when we arrived. We’ve left it cleaner than when we arrived, but providing some cleaning products (cloths, toilet cleaner, gloves, etc) would help future people with this. More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous. In short, we think the bach needs a check and a good clean before the next people come in."

We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

Otherwise there were a lot of annoying problems. First of all, this space is *tiny* and doesn’t have a good room for even 4 people to sit comfortably and just hang out unless you’re all cool laying in bed together or sitting on the floor. One of the chairs in the kitchen was broken when we arrived and wasn’t safe to sit on. The kitchen is advertised as well stocked, but they didn’t have basic things such as regular salt and pepper, measuring cups, or serving utensils. There’s no dishwasher, which is fine, but the dish soap provided had been watered down to be essentially useless and even that was almost empty. The fridge had spilled condiments in it that looked really old. A smoke alarm in the main bedroom wasn’t connected. There was also almost no room to park and this area wasn’t marked, so getting settled was stressful and the owners had to text us to explain things. The weirdest part of all of this is that the owners live maybe 100 yards from the place, so it’s wild that so many little things were just not taken care of and clearly hadn’t been in a long time. I also had a question prior to the stay and reached out to the property manager on VRBO and never heard anything back even after reaching out three times. 

My takeaway from this admittedly cute and well-decorated place is that it is much more concerned with aesthetics than being an actually functional place to stay. We made it work but dang. I’ve never had so much go wrong."

Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out.

Upon arrival on a Thursday was told we had no tv and no internet until Monday but actually didn't get it until Tuesday. We took a list to the property manager. Sharon Wright, of issues with the condo and here are only some: second king bed was actually 4 twin mattress placed on king frame and they wouldn't stay together, we was told this was not the way it should be and they ordered a new mattress but that did not show up until exactly 1 week after our arrival. The tv in that same bedroom did not work and they got a new one & brought it after a week . The Hurricaine shutter over master bedroom screen patio was hanging halfway down and was broken and was never repaired for the 26 nights we were there. I believe this is a fire code hazard as it blocked our escape if we couldn't go out the main door. The heat did not work and wasn't repaired. The second bathroom shower leaked water ( a lot of water) everytime it was used, again not repaired. We were short on towels & wash clothes & extra linens were not provided. Advertised beach chairs but only had 2 bag chairs. Sharon did get us 3 towels & wash cloths and 2 more bag chairs, not beach chairs as advertised but that took 6 days. The worse part was that Sharon promised delivery of many things at certain times but didn't show up at those times or take the time to at least call to let us know. we always had to call or show up at the office to find out why we didn't get the items and when would we get them. We did not report the washer but it was in the kitchen and so loud you couldn't hear the tv. 
The condo was not clean upon arrival. I took pictures of the issues. We did negotiate a refund due to the issues but we did not get 1/2 of the amount we had asked for.
I did call VRBO on the second day and stated telling some of the issues but wasn't done & our call was dropped and it was after he had asked me if my number was a good number to call me back on if we were disconnected but he never called me back after it dropped.

(I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

They charge you $35 DAILY ""resort fee"" which all that inlcudes is access to a rooftop pool that closes at sundown!! Then they charge you $40 DAILY parking fee!! Ontop of these fees if you want housekeeping to clean your room then that's ANOTHER $80 DAILY fee!! This listing & owner is UNETHICAL by charging ALL of these EXTRA fees!! You might think that you're getting a deal at $135 night for a ""beach front"" condo which by the way isnt even ""beach front"" its several miles away from the beach. Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!! You're better off renting a room at the Hilton or Marriot for $250-$275 at least that includes: housekeeping, parking, breakfast, clean towels, toliet paper, pools that dont close until 11pm, etc. The place was dirty too!! The first night I checked in I found feces on my bathroom towels!! Yes HUMAN POOP!!! There was also mold on the towels & on walls in the bathroom!! The floors were so dirty that they turned my feet BLACK!! If I can post pics I will!! The appliances are so difficult to work & understand because they're targeted to foreigners!! The stove & diahwasher just has symbols & knobs goodluck trying to figure out how to use them with NO instructions!! Three days into my stay the fire alarm goes off in the building awakening me out of a deep sleep that almost gave me a heart attack!! Everyone was forced to evaluate the whole building for almost 1hr!! This is what I paid $275 a night for? Day# 5 into my stay I'm sleeping & hear someone trying to enter my room mid morning? Luckily, I had the deadbolt locked & the extra lock mechanism. I most certainly heard several beeps coming from the door as if someone was trying to ENTER my room while I was sleeping!! Talk about SHADY ASF!! Day #6 into my stay I receive a knock at the front door around noon. I'm a professional poker player so I'm out playing poker tournaments until 6am in the morning I just got back to the room & finally fell asleep around 7am-8am. I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""? What a crock of BS if I've EVER heard!! You're better off finding a 4 star hotel & paying $250-$300 a night to be treated way better & NOT have to deal with a bunch of shady Mexicans trying to enter your room!!"

We ended up needing to call 911 and have the fire department show up to disarm. Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub.

It would seem that she is very busy lady with a lot of responsibilities, and not much time to dedicate to this vacation rental, or the needs of it's tenants. Eighteen friends and I have a yearly retreat, and our former lodging, a home in Heber was sold. This place seemed perfect for us, and it even had a hot tub, and beds for 21. Only we found out when we got there that there were only beds for 17, and the hot tub was broken. And things went downhill from there. The kitchen electrical circuit kept flipping off, and we learned that to use the microwave, we had to unplug everything else in the kitchen, including the stove. Also, a bedroom and the only bathroom in the basement had zero working outlets. When I texted Corinn about the electrical issues, she said no one had ever had issues like that before, so it followed that we could not be having those issues. When we checked the reviews, we saw that others had complained about the electrical issues. She did own that the hot tub was awaiting a part, and apologized. We all showed up with bathing suits-- such a disappointment! Then around 9 pm, a city water main broke, leaving us with no running water, no flushing toilets, until about 2:00 the next afternoon. So we spent several hours gathering snow in large bowls and melting it, oh so tediously, on the stove, a process that resumed again for several hours in the morning.
I reached out to Corinn the night of the water crisis and she said she would bring us drinking water the next morning, only she didn't. We kept melting snow and purchased drinking water and water to wash the dishes by hand. In addition, many commonly needed items were completely lacking -- kitchen basics like dish towels and extra paper towels, sharp knives, etc. The only thing to wash the dishes with were a couple of old, worn, mildewy sponges. At least 2 upstairs smoke detectors were broken, disconnected, and stashed in dressers. The basement bedroom with no working outlets also had no nightstands or bedside lighting or rugs on the cold floor. The television remote control had dead batteries, and no extras anywhere. The basement bathroom shower and curtain were dirty, and the whole house needed a deep clean. Many issues, little concern, and not following through on offer of recompense. With some care, this place could be a peaceful sanctuary, but we will keep looking 🥺"

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :).

Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard. The communication was subpar both locally and from Evolve. Very disappointing!"

There are multiple issues with this property that need addressing before anyone else considers staying here. These were the main concerns: 

1. My young 4 year old child found an opioid on one of the chairs. Luckily, my wife found it in their hand before any of our other children (ages 1-5) put it in their mouths. Otherwise we could’ve been staying the night in a hospital, or worse. Vrbo has been contacted. We reached out to the owner of the property about this, and it was completely ignored. Instead, they responded with a canned “thank you for staying” response.
2. No smoke detectors.
3. There is an odor in the house masked by air fresheners in every room.
4. The toilet would barely flush the entirety of our 12 hour stay.

Other things would need addressing as well, but this location cannot be stayed at again without the above addressed. We hope the owner takes our review to heart before renting this property again."

Two years in a row the heat was an issue. The manager/owner fixed it, but, it was something we had to deal with. One side of the stove is not working and the other side worked half the time. Hard to bake if the oven won't stay on and the kitchen is part of the reason we stay at this house. The kitchen needs a good cleaning. With a professional stove you deal with a lot of grease and the area around the stove and the vent area needs attention. We had to fix a few chairs that had loose legs when we got there and one of the chairs at the dining room table is broken. The grill on the back porch also needs a good cleaning. When grilling or smoking it ends up firing up because of all the old grease left on it and it has a few broken parts. The last thing is the wood burning fire place, the chimney probably needs a clean out. When starting a fire you end up with a lot of smoke in the house until the fire gets really hot."

There were no locks on the sliding glass door, and the front door he couldn’t find the key, so no security when we left the building.
