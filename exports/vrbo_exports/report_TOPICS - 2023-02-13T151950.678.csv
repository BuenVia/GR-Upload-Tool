Schon nach der ersten Nacht im Haus kamen unsere beiden Kinder (9 und 5 Jahre) am Morgen mit jeweils gut 100 Stichen an Armen, Beinen und im Gesicht aus ihrem Zimmer. Sie sahen einfach nur schlimm aus! Wir hielten es zunächst für Mückenstiche, doch aufgrund der heftigen Attacke, des quälenden Juckreizes und nach weiteren Recherchen waren wir sicher, dass wir ein Problem mit Bettwanzen hatten. Ein Arzt bestätigte unseren Verdacht. 

Wir haben sofort unsere Vermieter vor Ort informiert und auch versucht, Belvilla zu kontaktieren, doch weder unter der benannten Telefonnummer noch per E-Mail war eine Kontaktaufnahme möglich. Auch EuroTours als genannte Agentur vor Ort war völlig uninteressiert und untätig.

Unser Ziel war es nun, so schnell wie möglich abzureisen - allerdings auch, den Import der Parasiten um jeden Preis zu verhindern! ALLES wurde gewaschen, in der Sonne getrocknet und in schwarzen Säcken wärmebehandelt - unser gesamtes Hab und Gut. Drei Tage haben wir in einer Notunterkunft geschlafen, die unser Vermieter vor Ort organisiert hat, und jeweils am Tag den Rückbau bewerkstelligt. Es war ein Albtraum!

Mit dem Kammerjäger haben wir uns am Tag der Abreise ‚die Klinke in die Hand gegeben‘. Völlig fertig haben wir unsere Rückreise angetreten - 1.400 km non stopp. Denn unsere Nachfolge-Unterkunft in Österreich, wo wir noch 4 Tage verbringen wollten, mussten wir auch stornieren.

Eine Recherche hat schnell gezeigt, dass es offensichtlich Strategie ist, nicht erreichbar zu sein. Über den Facebook Messenger (!) haben wir den Mangel angezeigt, dann erst hat Belvilla reagiert. Man sollte meinen, dass Belvilla einen sofortigen Handlungsbedarf sieht, um den Schaden zu regulieren, aber weit gefehlt! Hinhalten heißt die Strategie. Nach langem, zähen Hin und Her hat Belvilla ein ‚Kulanzangebot’ unterbreitet, das nicht mal dem Tagessatz einer Übernachtung entspricht. Alles mit der Begründung, dass wir nicht den sofortigen Kontakt gesucht hätten. 
Das entspricht schlicht nicht den Tatsachen und ist einfach erbärmlich. 
Achtung: Belvilla ist höchst unseriös, nie wieder! Ohne Anwalt kommt man hier nicht weiter. 
Wir fragen uns - bei all den schlechten Bewertungen - warum dieses Unternehmen überhaupt noch Partner auf Portalen ist."

On the day of check-in I didn’t get any information from the host. 2hr before arrival I had to message the host and ask which apt was ours and how to get in. We weren’t given an apt number so we mistakenly tried to open two other doors before we found ours. Walking into the apt there was a strange smell and the bathroom smelled worse, like dirty pipes and poor ventilation for moisture. The shower wand needs to be changed, it’s so caked up with mineral buildup and mold that the stream that you get from it, is basically drops. The linoleum tiles in the bathroom are lifting because of the moisture and there was mold in the shower. And the water control didn’t really work, we had to play around with it to get a comfortable temperature otherwise the water would constantly go back and forth from very cold to scalding. The sheets on the bed weren’t clean, we found hair and just other debris and my sister would find red dots on herself the next couple days. There weren’t bed bugs so I’m assuming it was just a reaction to the sheets being dirty, but we did find ants in the apt."

However, I think the hot tub was dirty or there were bed bugs or something on the property because I came back from my trip there with itchy red bumps all over my stomach; the host started us off with 4 trash bags total for a group of 11 people for an entire weekend and had no extras so we had to purchase them ourselves; each bathroom only had max half a roll of toilet paper and there was no other toilet paper in the house so we had to purchase more ourselves; the cleaning instructions at check out were fairly intensive but we still had to pay a cleaning fee and I personally feel it’s one or the other. I think it wouldn’t have cost the hosts that much to have provided trash bags and toilet paper so we didn’t have to go out of our way to purchase them. It’s a small thing but it does affect how people view the house when you refuse to provide basic necessities that will last long enough for a large group. Also the trash can and dishwasher are pretty small for the size of the house and amount of guests that can stay there."

Do not stay in A1A or use Jackson Hole Real Estate Company whatever you do. We found bed bugs, lost a day of skiing, had to move mid week to a home ( a very gracious man lent us no charge) spent forever cleaning all of our clothes, not once but again when we returned home. Had to disinfect all of our luggage since it can't be washed, and you're still not sure if you're not bring the bed bugs back home. It was a disaster, no hotel or other rental would take us because we were coming from an infested location. And they decided to give us 1 night refund for a totally ruined ski vacation after promising $3000 refund when this was all going on. Too bad there isn't a zero star category."
