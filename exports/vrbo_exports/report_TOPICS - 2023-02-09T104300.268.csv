The ice storm this week brought so much damage and destruction to all of central Texas. The owners of the VRBO could have easily said we can’t host you as there were so many down trees and no power. They did not. In fact they were out there cleaning up and moving limbs and trees in between the storms. They were determined to make our wedding weekend happen. They went way above and beyond by allowing us to host our rehearsal dinner at the VRBO since our wedding venue did not have power. Bex stayed in communication with me all weekend. I can’t possibly give them a high enough rating. Thank you guys so much!!! I have a happily married daughter!!!!

I am always happy to give feedback and was willing to spend 30 minutes to do so. I was also very clear that I was not interested in any sales pitch and was assured that was not the at all what this was. They lied. The property has a very sophisticated vacation ""timeshare"" program and took two hours of my time. The only guidance I received from the Christian was to state that I was a guest of Mr. XXX"" which I did several times but that did not prevent them from the pitch. Felt as if he could have been more forthcoming with what to expect. 

On the last day, the state was experiencing inclement weather & power outages. Given the property was only at 20% capacity, I reached out to Christian to ask if we could extend our stay 24 hours until the roads cleared and was told they could not since the reservation was completed. I was given the suggestion to the front desk and ask (which I did) only to be given the off the street room rate of 3.5x what we originally paid. I was shocked and disappointed. 

I will provide a thumbs up to the condo itself. It was clean, comfortable and perfectly suited for my family."
