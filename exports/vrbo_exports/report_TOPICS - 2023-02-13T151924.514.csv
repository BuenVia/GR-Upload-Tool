There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

It is freshly painted, has a nice driveway and an attractive garden. Inside is a different story to the extent we have lodged an official complaint with VRBO.
We booked the villa a year in advance of our stay of 3 weeks in January 2023 on the basis of - to quote from the villa’s site - “completely renovated (end of works April 2019) and “a completely new kitchen and very well equipped.” These statements are totally untrue.
The kitchen is the same kitchen that was there in January 2014, some 9 years ago! Same cupboards, fridge, well used and grubby utensils and utensils’ box, rusty dangerous kettle (the steam pours out of the on/off switch where your hand goes.) and a filthy waste bin area. Random grubby and useless items were in the kitchen drawers. The gas hob had one non functioning and alarming ring which we had to avoid.
We have supplied VRBO with photographic evidence of all these comments.
The site quotes “sheets, linen and towels are hotel quality”. This was not the case - bed linen was thin and of poor quality and we were expected to have the same sheets throughout our 3 week stay as no clean ones were provided until we insisted the cleaner came and unlocked the cupboard the sheets were locked in.
No information/instruction folder was to be found on arrival which is essential when trying to settle in to a new home."

And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues."

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here."

We had high expectations based on the pictures of the house and our first stay. With the experience I have in the travel & tourism industry, I am used to reviewing properties. Unfortunately, Sandy Escape did not meet expectations. The following were the main issues:
 - The property was quite unclean with piles of dirt left in the downstairs bathroom. 
 - We advised there would be 10 adults staying but were only provided with 7 bath towels, even though information states bath towels are provided for all guests. 
 - Only 2 burners on the 6 burner stove work. 
 - The ice or cold water dispenser in the fridge did not work. 
 - The media/tv room on the first floor was very dirty with stains on the couch and the blinds unable to be used due to being damaged. 
 - All floors were very dirty. There is a broom but no dustpan and brush to be able to sweep up the sand/dirt.
 - Although hand soap containers were in both bathrooms and kitchen, they were empty and we needed to buy soap for them. 
 - No dishwashing liquid was provided to be able to wash dishes. 
 - They do provide dishwasher tablets for the 1 drawer dishwasher. 
 - Not enough plates or cutlery for 10 adults.

We were very disappointed with the state of the property and felt that it was a long way from being value for money. We would not be able to recommend this property. It is way overpriced for how it presents presently."

We cooked every meal but did not have any food storage options(Tupperware) for leftovers.

While this is a great location and very spacious, the king beds are very worn down and have big impressions in them which make it hard to get comfortable and sleep well.

When we arrived, there were past guest’s supplies left in the fridge, one tv had been damaged prior to our stay, lights out and flickering in fridge and microwave, and dishwasher did not really clean the dishes. There was a white film on all the dishes and they had to be washed prior to using.

Again, we had a wonderful time and it is a great location for a family ski trip, just a few considerations would have made it even better!"
