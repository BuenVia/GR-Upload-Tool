The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat. The property manager and owner said to leave the bedroom doors open and there are also 2 space heaters to heat the main areas. The space heaters were way to small to make a difference and the main areas were quite cold. None of the living room lights worked nor the living room fan, the pool was filthy, master bedroom faucet was loose, no cable, so no live TV, no garage door transmitters and the shower water pressure was not good. Due to having no heat in the main areas, we would not stay there again. We could look past all of the other issues, but with the main areas too cold to be in, we will look at other properties for our next visit."
