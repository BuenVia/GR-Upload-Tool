The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!"

The grounds are kept up perfect. A leaf dare not drop and it is swept up by the hard working gardener. The chef is delightful and made us lunch and dinner every day. You chose what you want on the menu the day before. There were a few miscommunications but all in all it went nicely. There is a helper to serve and bar tend, he was sweet and took great care of our margarita needs. He even led our group on a great hike to a waterfall. One of the highlights of the trip for the grandsons. They jumped off rocks into the river. The housekeeper kept the rooms clean and tidy everyday. My group said it exceeded their expectations and loved being right on the beach and having our own grounds. The boys loved learning to boogie board in the waves and warm sea water. There are boogie boards, pool toys, a ping pong table and kayaks too. Plus they supply life jackets. I loved listening to the waves crashing every night putting me to sleep. I had the window open all night and never needed the AC. I did get bites on my legs as I did not even use a sheet. I think there is a tiny bug called No See UM's. I got bit by those last year in Puerto Vallarta too. They itch like the devil. 
There are a few details that could be tended to. Like hooks on the back of bathroom doors, plastic covers taken off the lamps, a hand rail on the stairs going to the beach. But, those are very minor. You will not regret staying at Casa Mucumba. It is a beautiful."

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone."

The only issue we had was the stairs as both of fell even though we had treads on our flip flops.

Getting the correct address was challenging and when we did get the address it was 49 minutes away from the pin drop on this app. Luckily there was regular local buses.

There is very little beach most of the time none at all due to the sea, the steps leading down to the water is unsafe as its cracked on both sides so you are unable to go into the water from this access point.
The whole place smells of damp we had to keep the aircon on to stop the bedrooms from smelling. Leaving cupboard doors open. 
The cleaners put damp smelling sheets on the beds and we were left with dirty towels.
The kitchen cupboards also smell and apart from the microwave/coffee maker/cooker all other appliances listed are there but all have stickers on them stating they do not work.
Kitchen equipment is old and mix match. No scissors etc.
My friend got an electric shock from the smallest bedroom. The bigger room the plugs would spark now and again same for the plug by the kitchen bar.

The snow plows had come through after they had plowed the parking area, and they did not clean up the mound of snow at the end of the driveway. Our vehicle got stuck trying to get into the parking area, and we had to shovel the ice snow out. Worse than that, they only cleared off the snow on half of the steps, and that half was ice covered with no salt. It was also the side WITHOUT the railing, so there was nothing to hold onto as you climbed 2 stories of very slippery steps. One of my friends ended up falling. There was no salt on the property to help with the situation. We called and requested them to be shoveled and salted that night. No one came to take care of it until 1pm the following day. The back deck with the hot tub was not shoveled at all. We had to shovel it to be able to use the hot tub. There was no propane barbecue on the property, as was advertised. The house was clean except for the grease and animal hair on the waffle maker. The key was supposed to be located “to the right of the door”. A more accurate description would have been ‘on the handle of the garage door’. The manager did answer my phone calls and assisted, I was just VERY disappointed with the lack of snow removal (and failure to rectify it in a quick amount of time) and no propane grill on the property as was advertised."

However, there were some details that made us wish we had just gotten a hotel. Properties like this are the epitome of the poor STR offerings that are now commonplace.

First: This property is managed by a professional company. It is weird and inconvenient that they require guests to have to first visit an offsite location during their available office hours to check-in.

Second, the amount of messages and forms we were subject to after booking was dizzying. Once we had already booked and paid on VRBO, we were forced to fill out pages of additional forms via links with extra signatures and personal information, and then fill that information again in-person during check-in. They even prompted us to install another additional app altogether just for a 2-night stay. There were house rule sheets fed to us at every turn: in the emails, forms, on printouts, on the contracts, hanging in the home. I felt unwelcome by the end of it. The point is: booking through VRBO should be the sole source of our registration info and the house rules. All this extra stuff felt very unwelcoming.

Third: the home entrance itself was difficult to access. I wish I could post a photo, because the narrow stairs leading to the front door had at least a 3-inch thick later of slippery ice on top. It was almost comical how difficult it was to walk up the steps without assistance. We had to tag-team bringing in our bags because it was so dangerous to walk up. We couldn't have dealt with the ice if we'd wanted: all they provided was a cheap plastic snow shovel that couldn't come close to busting the ice. I can't believe they didn't clear the walkway and salt the steps before admitting guests.

Fourth: the instructions call for guests to take their garbage to the dump, after charging a cleaning fee! As paying guests (and as a short-term rental host myself), I had to laugh that these people require their guests to go run errands for them around town just to go check out. These hosts are a local company -- they can go make the garbage run to the dump themselves.

Needless to say, we won't be coming back to Big Bear anytime soon and I do not recommend Big Bear Vacations."

Not close to other cabins, nice view, and the house had everything we needed inside. The kitchen was perfectly stocked, above and beyond what is typically provided (still bring some extra paper towels, trash bags, and dishwasher pods with you, just in case). Beds and rooms were comfortable; both levels in the house have their own thermostats for comfortable temperature settings. Great natural light everywhere, and functional window coverings for privacy, in spite of large windows everywhere. We also really enjoyed the firepit - just remember to bring your own firewood, as it is not provided.

The only negative sides of the stay had to do with the quality of the construction. There doesn't appear to be any sound insulation between the two floors; it is extremely noisy downstairs when anyone as little as gets out of bed or walks across the room upstairs.

There is hardly any water pressure, if more than one faucet is used at the same time. With four full bathrooms in the house, this was an issue while trying to get ready in the AM, or cleaning up after hikes and activities.

There was a leak from an upstairs bathroom that was coming out on the stair steps; not a huge leak, but big enough to make those steps slippery and unsafe, if we didn't catch it.

There were several very large pieces of siding that came detached from the roof of the patio, and were hanging down very low, looking like they could fall off on our heads any minute. Made a large portion of the upstairs patio unusable during our stay. and we didn't really have a safe way to walk to the outdoor patio fireplace we wanted to use.

Last, but not least - don't attempt getting there in a low-rider small car that is weighted down with people and luggage. The road is very windy and steep, and there is a big gravel/dirt hump in the middle, which would have made things difficult for a lower smaller car.

Overall, good experience, and I am sure the property management will address the ""maintenance"" issues above (they were already beginning work on them when we called them in). If you're ok with ear plugs for the lack of sound insulation, and don't mind low water pressure, AND you drive at least a higher sedan or a crossover - this is a wonderful place for the whole family to enjoy! We will consider going back ourselves."

We were looking for a house with direct beach access as we were getting married on the beach and figured that would be easier than getting ready and having to drive somewhere else for the ceremony. The house IS beautiful with breathtaking views. It is very spacious. There are a lot of steps though. There is a whole bathroom and a suite with a king bed and en suite bathroom on the top floor along with a living room and kitchen. We put my grandparents in that bedroom so they didn't have to use the stairs except to leave.

The boardwalk and porch stairs can be slippery when wet so be careful in the morning and when it rains. The kitchen is well stocked so cooking is easy (except lack of dish towels). Definitely bring your own paper towels and toilet paper as the stuff they leave for you are terrible. Also bring extra blankets and towels. They do have some beach chairs and umbrellas!

The only reason I docked a star is because of the hot water. I guess the property hadn't been used in a while so the hot water smelled like rotten eggs. Badly. The smell filled the entire house. I called the office our first night there because if we were going to need a different property I wanted to deal with it night one so we could focus on the wedding. Someone from the office called about an hour and a half later, instructed us to just run the water and see if the smell goes away. We did exactly that in every faucet and shower. The smell did go away, but it filled the entire house. We had left to go to Night of Lights, dinner, and ice cream. The smell was so strong we could smell it even outside when we returned several hours later. It would be nice if the company would take care of this before someone arrives if the property has been sitting empty, especially for the cost. I'm glad it worked out well so we didn't have to scramble for a new stay while dealing with wedding stuff as well.

All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The house is beautiful and mostly worth it. If you have people with you with mobility issues, it may not work out or put them on the top floor to minimize going up and down. I would also encourage you to contact the rental company to inquire about anyone staying there and see if they can help you with the stench of the water. For the price and the fact it's vacation, renters shouldn't be left to deal with such a disgusting, pungent smell."

To start there was nothing in rental details saying that you cannot have a fire yet there is a fire place shown in the pictures and to be honest that’s part of going to a cabin in general especially when the weather is below 10 degrees outside it would be nice to use the fire place. Next we go up stairs and open all the blinds in the master bedroom to see the beautiful view before dark and we notice the bottom right window pane has a crack through it and the window was left open, then we see the top left pane is cracked and split in multiple locations which is almost dangerous if someone tried to operate that window.

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen."

We wanted a quite area away from crowds and we got it. Very few beach walkers and no venders. Alberto was present and showed us up to our unit. We were on the top unit. There is a unit below us as well as a studio down the driveway. 

The unit was very clean and spacious. The kitchen is well-appointed. They had a water dispenser with large jugs and replaced as needed. Plenty of lounging furniture. The balcony had a table with 4 chairs. I would worn those with children that the spiral staircase to the second floor loft may be a hazard. For adults you must be careful when reaching the top...there are 2 beams you must go under and it's very easy to bump your head. Doable but you must be careful. I don't think there is a remedy due to the design of the unit but just be aware of those that will be sleeping in that area. 

There was a paddle board and two kayaks to use as well as several water toys for children and adults. We didn't use the pool due to the weather but it was kept very clean. The outdoor shower and hose was great to rinse off with. We had a housekeeper come three times for the week and he did a great job including doing the dishes.

We had Chef Beto come in twice. I highly recommend having the welcome dinner. We were tired of travel and it was perfect. Very devious and plentiful! We had leftovers for days! 

Christina was very prompt with her responses and very accommodating. She truly wanted to please us!"

The 2 Bedroom unit was larger than expected, well supplied, clean and quiet. The pool area is right outside the Living Room Lanai and noise was not at all an issue when others were using the pool and grilling area, etc...

The step down from the Dining area into to the Living Room has two 4"" steps over an distance of 8 feet wide. We found this to be a concern moving at night without lighting. so we placed one of the Dining Room chairs at the base of the steps to alert us to the steps in the dark.

I had a night cough, so we used both bedrooms and the smaller one seamed to have some type of lingering order we couldn't identify.

The grounds were beautiful and the trail to the beach areas easy to follow. Everything in the description of the property was accurate and we used the beach chairs several times. The refrigerator freezer worked well until the last day when we had to clean out the ice storage bin so fresh ice could be produced,

We also found two of the Coasters were broken in the Living room. We threw them out as they could not be used and purchased a matching set of four coasters which we left for future users.

Overall we would rate the property as a FIVE!"

The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us."
