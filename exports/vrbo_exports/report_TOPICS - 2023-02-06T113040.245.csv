View was beautiful from the dining and living room, as well as the kitchen. The rest of the house furniture wise was a little dated but comfortable. This house is about a 2 minute drive to the ski lodge at appalachian ski mountain where our children were taking ski lessons this weekend. 

Our main issue for the house was its exterior condition. This house is located close to the top of the Appalachian mountain Ski resort which is often blowing snow, and some of that snow may blow back on the property. In addition, it had snowed a few days prior. When we arrived, the driveway was not plowed, and with the temps jumping above and below 32 degrees it quickly became very slick. We could not pull one of our cars out of the driveway as a result, and the walkway to the entrance was also covered in snow and became pretty slick (one of our members slipped on the way in). The next day one of us had to shovel and salt the driveway ourself to give a chance for our subaru to make it out. 

On top of this, the thermostat was set to 50 degrees when we arrived, and took overnight to warm up the whole house to 70. We had to keep our 2, 4, and 6 year old in their jackets the rest of the evening to keep them warm. My father in law also tried calling the number provided for the owner but never received a call back. 

When I contacted the owner via the vrbo app they indicated that it is hard to keep up with the snow at all times, and so the driveway and walkway may not be cleaned. They also said that they control the heat remotely via wifi so that perhaps there was a connection issue. 

Regardless, for folks who are making decisions in the future on where to stay, just note that these may be things that you might have to deal with after arrival during the winter season. Had we known that we would have to clean the driveway, we would have saved the expense and just stayed in a hotel."

Lots of spiders in the kitchen, randomly throughout the stay we would see spiders on the walls and ceilings.
When attention was brought to the owner of the issues his reply was ""this is due to the age of the house"".
Since when is CLEANING your house have anything to do with the age? You can have an old house and keep it clean!

First of all, I consistently received two emails for every reminder and every check in one from Austin vacay and one from a service manager. This made the check in process difficult because the code sent to me did not work. I called the property manager who answered after the second call and gave me a different number which worked. They apartment in our opinion was not at all how was presented on the website. The furniture and art is different (no big deal). The outside door frame is completely rotted away, the kitchen cabinet and drawers do not close. There is black mold in the air vents. On almost every door inside and out is chipping and peeling paint. They lid on the toilet is broken and clearly glued together. The apartment smells very strongly of odor ban cleaning solution and as it wears off you can smell cigarette smoke. The units around this apartment all have broken blinds and loud barking dogs (I know the property manager can't control the neighbors, but something that would have been nice to know). Both times I contacted the property manager (check in and when we wanted to talk about the property) I had to call twice before he would answer. Needless to say, we left the property and ended up getting a hotel. I called the property owner and explained our concerns, he was not willing to refund any of the money except the cleaning fee, which I still have not had returned to me. Had this been a cheap rental I wouldn't have cared so much but as you can clearly see if you're considering it, it isn't cheap."

The main photo they use to get you to book the property is not what you get. No patio furniture around the pool. Only rusted umbrella bases and rusted chairs. The pool heater does not work, so you cannot swim unless it is very warm in Florida. I am emailing the owner my photos that support these statements and I hope they will invest in their property."

No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds.

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen."

She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle

The property is about 1km walk from the village which was a nice stroll and not i convenient. The ski in was easy and ended about 50m from the property whilst the walk to put skis on is about 350m slightly uphill. The walk was simple enough.

All in all we really enjoyed the property and found it great value.

The hosts were 5 star hosts who no one would give a bad review. It makes you feel bad about noting imperfections about your experience with this apartment. 

During cold weather like we experienced, I would give the place a 3 out of 5. Our first night, we were freezing inside. This building observes the laws about maximum heat levels. That means the heat can stay on for a certain number of hours in the morning and evening so there is no heat while you sleep. Also there is a maximum temperature the thermostat should never exceed. It was literally freezing outside and there were definitely drafts. If I knew this before going, I would have booked elsewhere. Hotels and Airbnb's that I have been to prior do not enforce these rules. Anyhow, the next morning, the apartment became warmer when our host allowed the heat to be on continuously when we were home and they provided a space heater for the back bathroom which was the coldest area in the apartment. I only wish they noticed how cold it was and got permission for continuous heat from the beginning. 

Besides this, the apartment had a number other problems which are common for lower cost places. Shower doors which don't slide well, a leaky faucet, poor bathroom ventilation, chipping paint / mold in the bathroom etc. For anyone sleeping on the sofa beds in the front of the apartment, there will be significant night noise. But you don't hear that noise in the 2 bedrooms. 

Bottomline, if you want a GREAT location and a cheap accommodation, this is a fine choice. If you can easily afford better, I would choose somewhere else, especially if it is cold outside. For those considering this apartment in the hot summer, I wouldn't worry as much in early summer. I imagine that the place is a bit like a cave which will remain cool in the heat for quite awhile."
