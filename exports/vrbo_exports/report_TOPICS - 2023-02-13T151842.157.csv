If we would have known we would have cancelled prior to the final payment.There was exposed wiring, siding was removed,constant construction noise and concrete in need of repair. The unit was dirty, no hot water in the bathroom, the bed sinks to the middle and the sheets needed to be replaced. When we contacted the local contact he was rude and blamed the situation on us not letting him know sooner. We let the local contact know Sunday night that We were leaving. Our check out was for Tuesday.We tried to stick it out as we had already paid, but ended up leaving early when we had live cockroaches in the unit...there is a gap in the door frame."

Did not get check in instructions on where to access the property so i ended up unintentionally disturbing the front tenant's who were kind enough to tell me where to go. Upon accessing the studio there was an overwhelming musty smell inside. The studio was tiny (as described) but the bathroom was smaller than imagined. If you are any taller than 5'6 you will have to sit sideways on the toilet or you wont fit because it buts up to the wall. Then as i was getting the pull out bed ready for my son, i seen rodent poop under the cusions. I proceeded to pull it out and found more rodent poop in the bedding. I had to wash all bedding so my son wasnt sleeping in rodent poop and pee. Then as i was stripping the bed i also found other people hair. (Im hoping it was beard hair and NOT pubic) either way NOT how i wanted to start my weekend. I took pics and tried to communicated with the host. Communication was horrible and in the end they said the pics of the poop, hair, dirtyness (and exposed wire) was not enough to issue a refund. Horrible rental!"

We enjoyed our long weekend getaway with family and friends. The house does need some maintenance (door handles loose, broken doors on the downstairs entrainment center and dresser in master bedroom, and all the wall electrical plugs were all loose. Also the grill was rusted and in bad shape.. yes we did grill while visiting after having to get a grill cleaning kit). 

As far as Massanutten resort- wish I could say we enjoyed it but that is not the case. Purchasing tickets for snow sports is extremely difficult. Also- the Saturday we were there, a private rental closed the mini golf, GoKarts, and other activities. Not ideal in peak winter season. The slopes were so packed and just all around not the best experience of the resort itself.
The property served its purpose but we will not be returning to Massanutten Resort. 
For the host- easy check-in and effortless reservation process. Thank you!"

It’s nothing fancy, and has several issues, but it is clean and well supplied. 

 The resort is very nice. And the location is close to many places of interest. 

We had some difficulty and confusion at check in. The key is in a lock box that we struggled to get I open Once we did get into it we tried to open the door that the box was hanging from, but it would not open. We then discovered the key fit the sliding door. Small thing, but it was kind of frustrating after a day of travel. Then it became clear that the other door was another room that we did not have access to. Not a big deal, just would have liked to know this before hand. Nice backyard that we did not get to use because we were only there a short time. The small front porch had overgrown vines and dirty chairs. There was rain recently so maybe the host had not had a chance to clean them yet. 

If you’re just needing a place to land at night and don’t need luxury accommodations, this will be fine. It’s not fancy. There’s an unsightly tangle of wires hanging below the television. And using the television was confusing. If you’re cooking you have to step into the hallway in order to get into the refrigerator. The binder with information was just three pages and was not a great help. 

It was just ok."

We vacated 2 days early due to poor conditions. 
The entrance was at the back, was dark, cluttered & had a crumbling cement stairs. Out front had bags of garbage and toilets to be disposed of for two days after we arrived. The living room had poor lighting, had missing bulbs & the room was still dark after they replaced a bulb. It was too dark to read a book without a flashlight. One sconce was hanging by wires off the wall. The floor was unfinished between the kitchen & living room causing a tripping hazard. The kitchen light didn't work causing us to have to use our cell phone flashlights to see. One hall light flickered the whole time it was on. The noisy sliding BR doors were very hard to open and close. There were no closets or hooks anywhere to hang clothes in the bedrooms or the entrance to hang a coat. There wasn't enough hot water to take a ""quick"" shower. The windows had bars, ""not pictured"" on the listing. The windows and curtains were filthy. The kitchen counters and coffee pot had not been cleaned. The kitchen had water stained & sagging ceiling tiles. We would, periodically, smell sewer gas.
We did communicate with the manager during our stay. They did address replacing a couple light bulbs, however, the rooms remained dark and no light in the kitchen. She was sending our complaint with pictures we took, to the owner however, we have not heard anything back from the owner even 5 days later which is careless on his part. We regret that we paid $896.57 for 5 nights."

There are always some quirks with buildings that are as old and historic as these. I have never had a complaint or a bad experience until this time. 

The troubles started at check in. VRBO sent me an email with the apartment number and a door code. The owner sent me a text with a different apartment number and a different door code. I texted back that VRBO had sent me different information and verified that I should use the VRBO information. When I entered the apartment, there was someone staying there. I then asked the owner if I should go to the other unit, to which they replied I should and asked if I had the code (that they had just sent me). 

I entered that unit and looked around. It was nothing like the photos but I had dinner plans and did not have time to do a thorough inspection. I had some business that evening and the following morning, so I tried to connect to the wifi using the instructions provided. The network name provided did not appear, so I texted the owner. They responded quickly and said that someone would be out that night to repair it. No one ever showed up. I spoke to the occupant of the other unit and he said that he had not had wifi for his time there and was repeatedly told someone would come by to fix it. He was staying for a month and had not seen anyone come to fix it. 

When I returned from dinner I texted that the wifi was still not working and was told ""there is a green light on the box so it is good"" there is no box or a green light and the network name would appear only occasionally. When it did appear the multiple passwords that I was given did not work.

I did a more thorough inspection of the unit on my return. I found the tables and counters were sticky in spots, There was a used washcloth on the kitchen counter, the cabinet doors were on crooked and did not stay closed, the floors, walls, light switches, and shower were filthy. The toilet seat had only one bolt and slid off the stool when sat on, the rear door was duct taped closed but you could see light coming through. There were cords and exposed wires allover the unit. There was broken conduits with the wires exposed, electrical boxes duct taped closed and air conditioners that did not cool the unit down to below 75 degrees after 5 hours.

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again."

But it needs a full tear out and rebuild. Patio doors don’t close, cable boxes simply hanging by their cords. Only one tv remote for the four units in the building, we were only two people using one bedroom, but still a pain. Communicated with someone at the of a text line (always someone different) and they sent a note to a local rep, who responded, but never showed up with remotes. 
Everything worked, but the sofa was so old that we sank to the frame, so moved patio chairs inside. This wasn’t our first time in Casa, and friends are still there in another unit, with newer decor and furniture that can be used. 
I just cannot recommend this unit, until it has the doors fixed, the floors levelled and the ducting cleaned, because the patio doors didn’t seal tight we were having to run the furnace, which caused throat irritation to us and our friends when they visited. I have photos if needed."

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here."

1) ease of parking
2) plenty of dishes (though I would have preferred some drinkware that wasn't plastic)
3) there were sufficient towels for the four of us
4) The wifi seemed to work fine as did the oven and stove
5) I appreciated the communication before our arrival with codes, etc for ease-of-check-in. 

The bad: 
1) Fireplace is inoperable (not disclosed)
2) Only loud space heaters
3) Shuttle stop closed despite showing on the Angel Fire map (not disclosed)
4) No storage for clothing or guest groceries
5) Poor condition overall. The chairs had stains, the ceiling was peeling away in the bathroom, and the main bathroom had no cover on the lights and exposed wires. The floors had large gaps between the floorboards, the refrigerator can't open all the way because it's crammed into a corner, and the door in the bathroom hits the toilet every time you try to open it. The bedding on the beds isn't as fresh or clean looking as the photos. There were stains on the bedspread, there was a spider in the water reservoir of the coffee maker (eww!), there were crumbs or lint or something on the living room carpet, and there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher. 
6) The dishwasher reeked of cigarette smoke.

This house was DIRTY. I am talking cob webs everywhere, food crumbs everywhere, dead bugs all over.. hair from previous renters… linens smelled like body musk, kitchen was dirty and pots and pans and utensils were all dirty… . It was bad. When we arrived and saw this, I immediately called owner and she was very quick to respond but was surprised that the house was dirty. She said she never had this issue and that the last time the house had any guest was a few months ago… and that’s the last time the house had been cleaned. In my opinion and if I was in her shoes and I knew I had guest coming I would have the house cleaned!!!!!!!! I do have to say that the owner did send the cleaning lady to see the house but when she arrived all she said was that she cleaned and did her job and there was nothing else she could do. She offered Lysol for me to spray on the linens….. LOL!!! Then I called the owner and she offered to refund us 2 nights for the dirty house. By the time it was time for bed we noticed there was NO hot water… oh my god. NO hot water in January!!!!! We tried everything and couldn’t fix it… So again called the owner and she said her parents had went to turn the hot water off so the pipes wouldn’t freeze a few months ago.. (she failed to inform us of this before check in) she also said they had put antifreeze in toilets so the water wouldn’t freeze (what in the world???) she said she would call the plumber in the morning… so that night we had no hot water and had to boil some water for the kids to take a bath. The plumber did not show up till after 3pm… 
Thankfully he was able to fix it but he did say the way the lines and wires are in the front of the house was weird and dangerous… also all the beds were SUPER loud and old… this house definitely needs some maintenance and DEEP cleaning!!! These are just things a paying guest should not have to worry about. Period. The rest of our stay was just ugh. We had to stick it out because we came from Puerto Rico and my family came from New York and Raleigh and we had no where to go… the only up side was the out side… loved it!!!! The kayaking and the swing was nice! We did enjoy that and the fire pit! The house was awful and could not recommend."

This property had a lot of positives. The location was nice. Good neighborhood. Garage parking. Full washer and dryer. Wall A/C units. Plenty of space. Great views. Host communicated all requirements clearly and in a timely manner.

It also had some issues. Spiderwebs on just about every ceiling, with spiders. I had to kill and clear one above the master bed before we could sleep. The house gives off an “unfinished” vibe. There are open holes/outlets with wires sticking out. Like there used to be a tv or sound system wired, but it’s a lot of wires. One of the water faucets, the top came off if you pulled on it to turn on the water. All of this added up to a very cheap feeling for the house and I felt not worth the money. I paid $730 NZD/night. 

Also, and this is just more of an oddity, there are so many light switches and either we couldn’t figure them all out or some of them don’t work. Like, more light switches than ever I’ve seen in a house."

It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving.

Check in was smooth at the office in central Malaga where we were allowed to store our luggage until 4pm.

The apartment was clean & the large balcony became an afternoon sun trap after midday during February.
Beds were firm & comfortable & showers plentiful with good pressure & hot water. Air conditioning/ heating kept most rooms warm when the temperatures dropped in the evenings.

Location was everything: Quiet & although the apartment is about 2.75k from central Malaga we loved the walk along the seafront. Bus services the regular (No’s 40 & 7). Running & scooter rides along the front really made the break. 
Plenty of excellent local restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the apartment negating the need to go into central Malaga. Particularly liked La Mafia, Terra Mia and Taco Box.

Some not so positives in our experience were:

- No hand wash in bathrooms or kitchen ( important post Covid I would have thought) rather than tiny soaps.
- No plugs in the bathrooms/ kitchen - difficult to have a quick wash or clean plates & cups in the kitchen.
- Kettle was very small & difficult to use. Looked unsafe (electric wiring exposed) & hot steam vented on to your hand when pouring."

The location of this unit is excellent. It’s super close to the slopes and we had a good view from the balcony to see our kids going down the slope. It was right next to the laundry room too, which was really convenient. There was a good selection of cookware and dishes in the unit, as well as a blender and a crockpot. The weren’t very many spoons/forks but we brought our own plasticware and disposable cups/plates/bowls so we were set. The listing indicated there was a Keurig, but there was not - there was a Mr. Coffee brewer so the k-cups we brought with us were useless. 

I’ve never stayed at any of the other condos in this complex so I cannot say how this one compares to the others, I can only share my experience/observations. 

Between beds, bunks and a pullout sofa, it slept eight. There was only enough seating for four people unless you used the barstools. The beds weren’t terrible, but they weren’t great either. Probably depends on what you’re used to. I’m told the bunks slept terrible. 

First thing we noticed when we arrived was the smoke alarm just inside the entry was hanging by wires and was covered with a plastic bag. Having no idea what was going on, we left it as it was. In addition to that, the toilet in main bath was shimmed on one side and didn’t appear to be properly attached to the floor, as it sometimes lifted off floor if you moved a certain way while using it. There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again."
