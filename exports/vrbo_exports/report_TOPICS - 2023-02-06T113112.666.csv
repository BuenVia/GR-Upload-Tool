Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing."

Right on the beach with a heated pool down below. Close to good restaurants and shopping. But the unit itself was sadly lacking in care. Doors hanging on hinges, bathroom fixtures falling off, furniture scratched, dirty and kind of cheap, broken window blinds, hard beds, suspicious stains on one of the only 2 beach chairs. And it needed a thorough deep clean. I had booked the place for myself and four friends and was somewhat embarrassed. I will definitely not go back.

The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around, the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs earlier if it was allowed. They said yes, one hour no problem and 2 hours yes for $50 each of those hours. Since it actually came to about $5,300.00 for the 3 nights (2 days) another 100 bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on the check out .procedure."

They assured me it was going to be the one listed and it was not. We were happy with our unit, regardless. One of the key FOBs was very finicky (low battery perhaps?) and we were stuck in the parking garage upon check out for 20 minutes until another vehicle come through and let us out with their FOB. The owner was responsive in a timely manner but seemed put out by this requiring their attention and somewhat dismissive at the suggestion the FOB needed attention.

Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!"

It was snowing and about 18 degrees. I immediately started calling the management company but after remaining on hold for 20 minutes which was enough time to hear the timbertop jingle enough times to memorize it! I went and bought a dust pan at the local store , placed some plastic wrap over the window and shoved a chair against it to help with the draft since we had babies and small children arriving. . I tried to contact the property manager by email and was unable to contact anyone that way either. One of the King size beds was actually a double. The refrigerator looked like someone tool a shot gun to it, The lampshade in the living room was shredded. The 4 ammenities -hot tub,- (smelled funky) pool(slimy bottom), pool table (no tips on sticks- no chalk) and theater room(would not connect to surround sound) all had issues. We were missing an entire shower curtain in one of the bathrooms, the dryer didn't dry(heating element?) and a towel rack promptly fell off the wall when a towel was applied. I was able to contact the company the second night of our stay and they sent someone out the 3rd night. We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic.

We were excited to check in and enjoy the hot tub and pool right away as we had been traveling all day and my family was looking forward to relaxing. Unfortunately when we arrived at 5 PM, the pool crew was waiting to repair a broken heater, it wasn’t ready for a few more hours and it was still cold. There are no instructions on how to control the hot tub/pool heat so I called Vacay Stay to get a tutorial and was informed that there are restrictions on the temperature settings unless we wanted to pay extra (they did offer a late checkout for the inconvenience though). Considering it was in the 40s and 50s while we were there, the swimming pool was too cold at 78° to utilize. In addition to the pool/hot tub issues the top rack of the dishwasher didn’t work so after another call a crew was sent to remove it, not fix or replace it. As a family of five, we ran out of dishes each day because we couldn’t wash them all in the now half capacity dishwasher. On top of that, there were only five forks in the entire house, which made for another headache, having to hand wash dishes after every meal (certainly a favorite vacation activity). We called Vacay Stay again and they did bring additional forks. 

There’s no local television programming available at the home so unless you have your own streaming services don’t expect to watch any tv. After a long exhausting day we were ready to call it a night, and what a long uncomfortable night it was!! The master bedroom has a king size bed with little to no support in the middle and we found ourselves rolling into a king sized hole all night long! This made for a miserable night sleep with stiff backs the next day (which fyi, a cold hot tub doesn’t really help). We again called Vacay Stay who told us that there is nothing wrong with the bed, it’s just a soft mattress. 

Aside from all of the minor issues and headaches above, the lovely touch of kitchen utensils and broken broom handles wedged into the windows for security because the locks are broken was special. The neighbors dog that didn’t stop barking for four days straight was just the added touch every guest is looking for! 

Oh, did I mention the freight train washing machine? Make sure to do the laundry while you’re out and about, it has a slight rumble that could easily be mistaken for San Andreas fault activity."

That was not communicated to us beforehand so make sure to double check if you are wanting that option.

We had some sun, some rain and cooler temps. We looked forward to sitting outside in the back and inside to talk and write. We were visiting another friend in our Writers' Group. We were disappointed the owners haven't kept the property up to date and many things are deteriorating. We were disappointed with Vacasa, as property managers for not doing simple repairs like attaching door knobs and keeping lights working. There were post-its noting what wasn't working! We sent this list to Vacasa of the problems:
1) The main bathroom and bedroom (by pool) smell like rotten sewage and mold. We are allergic to mold and had allergies during our stay. Those rooms are only useable when the windows are open, which is cold and a safety hazard since they are at ground level. 
2) Driveway gate entry keypad doesn’t work. Vacasa knew, but gave us a code at in person check-in and let us try. When I called Vacasa back I learned it didn't work (?!)
2B) Driveway gate entry key fob in house only will open or close once. If we wanted to open, leave the driveway, and then close the gate, the gate would not close. Gate box does not respond to the key fob on any second request.
3) Issues around the house were simply noted on post-it notes around the house, as if that made the issues ok. 
4) The only outside door that works to the backyard (two others were locked down) had this post-it: “Door handle falls off.” Once in back, it’s difficult to get back in because the handle falls off (it only needs a set screw).
5) Important inside lights do not work. Some are noted on a post-it. The main kitchen light is out. So is laundry room/back hall light, which is the only light at night to the second bathroom. The exterior driveway/breezeway light, visible from the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom, is motion detect and strobes when on, which is distracting. 
6) The listing leads one to believe that guests will have two bedrooms with two fully working bathrooms, ""perfect for two couples.” However, one bathroom is across the house. The main bathroom’s “soaker tub” is a one-person wall tub with a note on it “tub is not operational”; its plumbing and tap are closed-off.
7) The bath's retro ""features"" are rotting and deteriorating. 

Overall, the house is not as advertised. Location is good, backyard and pool are nice, but can not carry this amount of issues. Repairs and updates are needed."

The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs hotel earlier if it was allowed. They said one hour early- no problem and 2 hours yes for an hourly fee.. Since it actually came to over five racks for the 3 nights (2 days) another few bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on how to check out. Argumentative"

Cons:

Can confirm there are many minor issues in every room. 

Stained comforter, mildew in shower door, broken toilet paper holder, double wall windows had inner windows shut but some outer windows open. 

Fireplaces did not work.
 
Kitchen was barely supplied, no salt or pepper, gross sponges and soap container, only a few pots and pans and only 2 sheet pans total.

I know it sounds dumb but the light switches were confusing. There would be a panel with 3 switches where one is power to the switch the middle one is also power but with a dimmer and the third one was a mystery switch that did nothing. 

Dvd player seems to function until you put a dvd in. Myself and 2 others all have 4 year degrees in computer related fields and none of us could figure out the AV situation in any room. 

Outdoor space was winterized (duh) and this is onky a con because it obviously hadnt been looked after for a year or so because there was dirt build up on everything. 

The gas grill downstairs was a joke. I dont think you could fit more than 2 burgers on it and the gas wouldnt ignite even. 

Downstairs kitchen had 1 plate and a dirty knife in a drawer otherwise empty. 


It is out in the country so if you arent used to country darkness it may seem very dark. That being said the drive out there is incredibly hilly and winding with multiple blind hills where you cannot see over them until you are over during day and nighttime. And the drive into galena is 30 minutes away 



Pros: 

Decently secluded and thick walls give great privacy. 

Water pressure was awesome. 

Hot tub was clean and hot when we arrived but the floor was soaked from previous rainstorm. Also only door to hot tub from inside is through the master bedroom. (Sorry not a pro, I know) 

Lots of cups bowls and plates

Plenty of parking room 

Great view of nature from all windows

Plenty of fridge and freezer space 

Comfy couches

Lots of games 

Held heat very well and distributed heat well 

Plenty of towels/wash cloths




All in all like i said 80% correct, place honestly just needs some small fixes everywhere and it would be perfect."

This property was advertised as a two bedroom. It is NOT. It is a studio apartment with a bed and a futon in the kitchen. 
Upon arrival my family and I came to a parking area and this stay is located in the back building behind a car park, a bit sketchy and uneasy feeling. Upon entry, the hallway leading to the apartment was wide open, and mailboxes were broken and smashed in. We get to our door and the lock box barely worked.

The bathroom photographed in these photos is not the layout of the actual bathroom we had. 
The faucet for said bathroom was also broken. Upon booking in Oct when I wrote to the host, he never got back to me. Upon arrival, it took VRBO and myself several attempts to reach the owner and they did not respond to any of my messages until after the remainder of payment was made. 
After contacting VRBO, and by THEIR suggestion to contact the owner/manager of said property to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. 
To may dismay their attempt to rectify the situation by giving them a day to ""change the sheets""...... the one with blood and pubic hair on them....

We decided not to stay because of the unsanitary practices of listing and misrepresentation of the listing, and because as a guest I believe that their resolution was unsatisfactory. 
We were advised by VRBO that we could not cancel since we arrived at the location and it was up to the owner to decide whether or not they wanted to refund our money.... you can see where this is going. Even though I wanted to cancel the reservation the DAY OF arrival. 
6-8 phone calls/chats later and ""we're sorry you've experienced this"" with VRBO for the promise of sending my inquiry to management... nothing, no response, no follow up and 8 case file numbers later.

Kitchen units are old and bursting at floor level, fridge was absolutely tiny and shelves fell off the door, all have hairline cracks. The owner did replace the washing machine, which was temperamental. Bathroom sliding door kept falling off the mounting. Both of us jammed our hands in the patio doors, as there’s no safety stop. Inside the house was like a fridge in winter, we had to clean mould several times and our clothes were wet in the unlined wardrobes. We bought many humidifiers. No aircon means the walls are like powder and the house manager was unable to replace the curtain pole or fix the shower properly to the wall. We lived with the curtains held up by tape for many weeks. This could be a lovely house, but it needs work. The patio area gets no winter sun, but the roof does, the furniture on the roof however needs replaced, it’s not just ugly, it’s dangerous. If it’s important, the TV only had Spanish Channels. We used our own steaming stick, which worked, but the sound quality on the TV is tinny at anything above quite. The house was clean on arrival, but inside the cupboards were grimy and some crockery sticky with grease, which j didn’t use, as there’s just far too much crockery and unnecessary stuff in a rental. I binned the toilet brush, after it was knocked over and I won’t go into detail, but I binned it and left a brand new one for the owner, it was disgusting. We needed to buy a basin, as the sink didn’t hold water. The additional blanket provided was dirty and too bulky to wash in the machine in the house, I thankfully had taken our own throws. No towels provided by the owner. If we didn’t have a dog with us, there’s no way we would have stayed in the house, not in the condition it’s in.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool."

O caseiro que deveria cuidar da limpeza externa e piscina, mal o víamos durante nossa estada. A casa necessita de uma reforma ampla, as camas são box, porém só tem uma espuma que vem na cama, ou seja, não tem colchão, as noites foram muito mal dormidas. Nas suítes inferiores não tem janela de ventilação, em uma determinada noite caiu um pedaço do forro de gesso, quase atingiu uma criança que dormia. No anuncio consta como 7 suítes e na verdade são 6 suítes e um closed que foi considerado como quarto. Pegamos dois dias de chuva, ai apareceram várias infiltrações pela casa, quando utilizávamos a churrasqueira era goteira pra tudo que é lado. No anuncio constava que água, energia e internet faz parte do aluguel, porém o proprietário queria nos cobrar R$300,00 por um caminhão pipa de água potável, isso gerou um stress devido as várias mensagens que recebi nos cobrando essa conta. Por fim, após uma ampla reforma a casa Boedo se tornará atrativa, mas antes que isso aconteça não recomendo."

In the year since I was last here, the property (unfortunately) has clearly not been maintained. 

- The home has a lot of wear and tear, and has a dingy feel to it. Lots of dings in the walls and doors, worn/stained carpet, loose bannisters, broken window shades, etc. I question if the sheets in my bed were changed, based on all the hair when I pulled back the covers the first night.
- The plumbing was an issue during our stay, with a leaky pipe in one bathroom, and a broken handle in the other. To be fair, the local property manager Keith was on it in a hurry.
- The hot tub was a nice add, but the water was terribly filmy. It takes more than a chlorine floaty to keep those things clean.
- The kitchen still does not have enough utensils for cooking, and only glassware to drink out of- not good if you have kids! 
- The check-in/out process is very easy, as Vacasa provides a lot of information.
- As stated above, the local property management is very responsive. This was the case last year as well, which was a pleasant surprise this time around.
- Lastly, this would be a really nice place to stay with just a little more TLC. The home has all the potential to be a solid vacation rental- it has great amenities, its in a decent location, and its fairly close to stores, restaurants, and the ski resort."

The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people."

It was initially hard to find since the there were no distinguishing signs for the turn off to the location. After calling the caretaker, she was able to talk us through the directions to the property. The place was comfortable, but could use a bit of maintenance. It wouldn’t take much to make this place a 9 out of 10. As it stands it’s probably a 6/7 out of 10. Fresh paint to cover water stain in the ceiling, replace broken bathroom exhaust fan cover, replace torn porch window screen. All of those cosmetic issues give the place a shabby look. On the positive side, the place has all you need for a short stay. Nice kitchen with full size refrigerator and utensils for cooking. Adequate seating in the living room. Tv with cable service and fast wifi. Bed were comfortable. The 1 bathroom was adequate in size, just a bit dated/worn down, but clean. It’s a short drive to Key West so it serves at a nice jumping off point. Did not get to use any of the other amenities such as the pool since we were there in January. Good value for the price and condition of the property. Would stay there again. Beware of hidden fees. His was my first Vrbo rental so that maybe typical for the service."
