Everything was very clean and had everything we needed. There was plenty of place to sleep, even beds for the kids! They had games for the kids to play and if you have young kids they include a high chair and crib. The location was perfect! Walking distance to several restaurants and close to all attractions! 
Only suggestion, for safety reasons I would fix closet fires so they don’t fall and hurt someone and provide better lock for bathroom downstairs. 
We would absolutely stay here again! Communication was excellent! Thanks for a wonderful stay!"
63e00f32a5d0c678613d991a,8181906838,NOT SPECIFIED,82979888,1675628421930,05/02/2023 20:18:58 CST,newly renovated canal home w/ hot tub and dock,en_us,83,floramar terrace,"No salt & pepper, cooking oil, cooking oil spray, no recycling bin, no waste baskets In laundry room and bedrooms, slippery tub with no tub mat, only seating in living room area is an uncomfortable couch.",HR_REVIEWTEXT,"Pluses: Clean property and safe location. Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers. No salt & pepper, cooking oil, cooking oil spray, no recycling bin, no waste baskets In laundry room and bedrooms, slippery tub with no tub mat, only seating in living room area is an uncomfortable couch. Property is listed as sleeping 6 but only seating for 4 inside. Too small for 6. Instead of spending $$ on a sofa bed and an inflatable bed on lanai & a karaoke machine, they should provide more basics."
