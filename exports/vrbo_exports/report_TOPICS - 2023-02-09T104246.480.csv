While it would have been nice to have a baby gate (or 2) and a crib we had a wonderful time. It was very cozy sitting in the middle of the woods. The oven set off the fire alarm every time we opened it but it was reassuring that they all worked! Greybeard’s management team was very helpful when we came to them with problems. Would be back again in a heartbeat.

Cathy’s place was certainly familiar to us and it helped make our trip great! I’m house laundry is sooo convenient! Check in was easy. The main toilet had trouble with refilling the tank and the smoke detector battery was low which resulted in chirping. We informed her about it and she was fixing to take care of it. The bed was plenty comfy. Windows and sliders open for a nice cross breeze. The place stayed plenty cool for us to sleep at night. Kitchen could have been better stocked with spices. Sift through some of the beach amenities to make sure they function well- both umbrellas we tried to bring with us were broken. But this is all very small stuff and we had a great time regardless! Love the North Shore!

And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues."

Condo was well equipped however many items clearly well used and in need of replacement/repair (dull knives, broken blender etc.), lanai light did not work, lanai sliding door required lots of fiddling to lock every time as well the blinds in ""children's"" bedroom were completely broken as well as the screens so we got quiet a few visiting bugs and creatures (geckos) and subsequent bug bites. Lots of disrepair such as broken tiles, mold on shower doors (note: sliding bath doors very challenging to bath/shower kids), and build up on sinks/tubs/facets. Pool side only plastic dishes allowed however only plastic glasses provided, no plates etc. Well equipped for kiddos (pack and play, booster seat., umbrella stroller etc.). Property management was great at communicating with issues (chirping fire alarm). Overall it was a good unit but needs some love and attention."

It was a little bit too difficult to navigate as it got darker earlier in the day and it was pitch black when we arrived. One of the rooms kept beeping throughout the day every half hour which we're assuming was a fire alarm needing new batteries.

However it was still a great trip and we loved the labeled kitchen as we were able to cook through out the day without having to spend time searching for utensils. 
We definitely plan on returning in the future."
