Checked in Sunday night and saw the first of many. Contacted the property manager and stated I needed pest control out there the next day. They said they would then said Tuesday. I was in town for business and moved all of my morning meetings to the afternoon to meet pest control between 8 and 12. Never showed, the last communication from manager was at 3:30pm asking me if pest control showed up. Dismissive of customer concerns which are legitimate concerns. Place did not have any smoke detectors, shares a water heater with the apartment upstairs so your shower is out of hot water in 5 mins. Will NEVER stay anywhere Silver Street Management is associated."

It is huge, beautifully decorated, and well stocked. Those complaining about having to supply certain items obviously do not stay in villas very often. The pool was great, warm and tons of fun for the kids. We brought our own pool toys and games and threw them away prior to departure. Loved the room set up, location of the house, community security, etc. We take 1-2 trips to Florida each year. It’s been our family tradition for over 18 years and we always rent villas. This was our first rental with Blue Skies and I must say, I was impressed with their policies, how communicative/responsive they were (love the text feature!). Challenges with the house: when we arrived, at check in, the cleaners were still inside cleaning. No biggie, but we had been waiting at the clubhouse for HOURS and were ready to settle in. The house was clean, but there was a bandaid in the pool (we scooped it out with the net), the projector was broken (was a bummer but we didn’t care enough to contact the management company, there is soooo many other things to do! Like splash in the pool!!), and to our horror, there is seemingly a roach infestation. There are large size water bugs or cockroaches in the upstairs area (mainly saw in the master bedroom and laundry room), but there are what seem to be German (??) cockroaches that have infested the kitchen area. The first one we saw was dead in the master bedroom on the main level, but then we started seeing them throughout the kitchen. Drawers, on the stove, cabinets, and hiding in dishwasher. We bought raid, and lots of Lysol spray and wipes, but knew it wasn’t the solve. I contacted management and they sent an exterminator IMMEDIATELY, which was appreciated, but didn’t solve the issue either. I am not quite sure why there is a possible infestation because the house is CLEAN. The only thing I can think is because the fridge is leaking water from the freezer or whatever the water source is and perhaps that draws them? Not sure. But other than that, the house was great. We did wash all of our clothes in hot soapy water the night before we left, folded, and placed IMMEDIATELY in our LYSOLED suitcases and placed DIRECTLY in the rental van to ensure we didn’t bring any unwanted guests/hitchhikers home with us. All that said, I would rent from Blue Skies again, just maybe not this house. Which is shameful because it’s BEAUTIFUL. (And no, never experienced bugs in any other villa.)"

The property managers sent out a pest control person and he set up bait traps to catch even more cockroaches. He also explained they were German cockroaches and not Florida cockroaches so to be careful because they could become passengers in our luggage easily.

our place wasn't even that clean (we left it cleaner than when we arrived to it). Very old property, very outdated, even the guys who run the place say that everything else is updated
and this is the only place that isn't up to date and the host that runs it doesn't care. First Aid kit isn't even up to standard, fire extinguisher was not secured. The first couple of days only 1 elevator worked so we had to carry all our luggage by stairs (14 flights). We were required to do our own dishes upon leaving which I didn't have an issue with besides it not being properly sanitary for the next people to come or for those who were here before us, how do we know that it was actually done sanitary up to code for people not to get sick or diseases. I sent the message to the host requesting a refund and informing of the issue, but the host didn't even have a decency to reply back or acknowledge her mistakes. Stove is outdated same as the fridge. We tried getting another hotel the second night we were there but we couldn't get anything due to it being booked out and we paid around $2900 for a week, way overcharged. I could have gotten a Hilton property for cheaper than that. I can see maybe paying $1000 for this place but no more than that."

The owner provides the bare minimum. One soap, one toilet paper, 2 trash bags and a few towels. We had to purchase napkins, dish soap, trash bags, sponges to wash dishes, and more...

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager."

The place has everything you need for an extended stay. We stayed for three weeks and bought a vegetable steamer which we left at the property. Pics are accurate but we were told that the throw pillows were for staging only. Those are important to us for lumbar back support. The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues. That means it is mostly an issue with the router, not the modem or the internet connection to the property itself. Although, normal router was still good for YouTube or Netflix. The place was clean but I would say it needs a deep clean. Shower pan is one example. The bed is comfortable and linens are top notch. We did find baby cockroaches in the kitchen area and bathroom and bought the roach motel thing at the market. This is Hawaii and so, we weren’t surprised but also not great. Just keep your food containers sealed or in the refrigerator. Another con is the proximity to the pool and jacuzzi. Both can get loud at times. But noise cuts off if you close lanai door. Also, everyone is out of the pool area by 10 pm. The pro is that the unit is really super close to the pool and jacuzzi and we enjoyed them quite a bit. All in all, we would come back."

That said, this unit is only okay. The unit itself is nicely furnished. However, it has a number of drawbacks. First, there were big reddish cockroaches in the kitchen. The location is tropical, so we did not freak out too much about the roaches. Second, the unit sits on top of the office and laundry room for the complex. In itself this is not a big issue, but everyday there were maintenance people hosing off stuff right outside our window at about 6:00 AM. Also, there are parking lots on 2 1/2 sides of the building, so people driving/parking/talking at night were noticeable. Moreover, one jalousie windows in the master bedroom would not close all the way because vines had grown up into the window. I tried to move the vines out, but I couldn't get to them because the knobs that hold the screen on were rusted closed. The slightly open windows made the noise worse. Third, there is an ocean view from the living room, but it is very distant. The unit is farther from the water than any other unit and the ocean view is between two buildings. That sounds a little worse than it is. The two buildings are far apart, so the view is okay, but quite distant.
Finally, all the interior doors are louvered, so privacy is impaired somewhat. I would recommend that at least the bathroom door be converted into a solid door."

It’s very spacious and the heated salt water pool is fantastic! I was already planning in my head a 5 star review. HOWEVER, in the middle of the night when my daughter went to use the restroom she noticed a large bug in the bathroom. None of us thought too much of this except for when the next day we came home from being gone most of the evening and my son found a roach on his backpack, and upon further searching the house there were three roaches found throughout the kitchen and also one in the master bathroom. Now we are up to SIX roaches. That is disturbing! It gets worse. Eventually a palmetto roach the size of a small mouse crawls out from underneath the couch. After we called the next day and reported the infestation someone dropped off some bug spray for us to use and said “Hey, it’s Florida and we have roaches.” 

On Sunday night I lift up the lid of the washing machine to do laundry and there is a live roach sitting on the inside lid ledge of the washing machine. 

I am having a hard time wanting to recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone else because I’m afraid they would experience the same roach problem too.

I had insomnia during our stay because I was worried about the roaches crawling into my bed. I was also concerned about possibly bringing roaches home with us in our suitcases and bags. For the price we paid, I would not expect roaches to be in this nice of a place.

We tried reaching out to the property manager after our stay, but no one responded to our emails or tried contacting us."

Lamp shades were torn in some spots. The biggest issue was seeing about 6-8 cockroaches in the kitchen over the last few days. I understand there are roaches in Florida, but we probably will not be going back there knowing this space had a visible problem."

And pest control didn't come until a few days into our stay. Even after they came, we still had the pest issue. The overall cleanliness of this house was poor. The hot tub was dirty and drained and therfore not in working condition. This was misleading as it was shown in working condition in the photos. Also the second day we had no hot water. Someone did come fix that issue that day thankfully. Very very disappointed"

No reply from the emergency number when rung repeatedly, so we forced the door open. The property is infested with cocroaches that come out in the late evening. The pots and pans need replacing. An aircon would assist in the hot weather we experienced, and not having any internet is a drag. This sounds like we had a bad experience, but no, we generally had a lovely time and enjoyed this small, quaint cottage immensly. Wooli is great, and my first experience of this area. The place is beautiful and very relaxing. All up, a lovely week. Thank you."

-Lage zum Strand ist gut

Negativ:
Es war ein furchtbarer und ekelhafter Aufenthalt! Wir haben alle Mängel aufgelistet & aussagekräftige Bilder an die Vermieter (VM) geschickt. Diese haben die Mängel nicht wahrhaben wollen & gemeint, wir würden mit der Lupe danach suchen. Leider gibt es in der Bewertungsfunktion keine Möglichkeit Bilder hochzuladen & nur begrenztes Zeichenlimit. Die Bilder wären für jeden erschreckend!
1. Kakerlaken: Es sind viele Kakerlaken in der Küche unter der Spüle. Sie kommen nachts raus & sind morgens neben dem Bett, unter den Schuhen, neben der Kommode usw. Wir zeigten das Problem & man sagte uns, wir sollen Insektizid als Spray holen & einfach überall hinsprühen. Dies ist nicht nur gesundheitsschädlich, es half auch nicht. Bis zur Abreise Kakerlaken in der Wohnung! Viele wären direkt abgereist.
2. Dusche kaputt: Der Duschhalter ist doppelt kaputt, um Höhe & Winkel einzustellen. Wir mussten Kabelbinder für 5 Cent kaufen, um die Brause zu fixieren. Das Geld wollte VM nicht geben & bedrohte uns, dass wir das wieder abmachen sollen bei Auszug. Irre!
3. Wasserschaden: Über der Brause trat einige Tage nach Anreise ein Wasserschaden auf. Die Decke platzte herunter, die Farbe rieselte tagelang in die Dusche. Es war alles total staubig in der Dusche, Abfluss wurde dadurch verstopft.
4. Hellhörigkeit / Glascontainer: Direkt vor der Wohnung in 3m Entfernung zur Haustüre ist ein Glascontainer, in den 24/7 eingeworfen wird. Extrem laut, nachts wird man dadurch geweckt! Spanien ist hellhörig. Aber diese Wohnung übertrifft einfach alles. Nebenan hört man sogar Handy der Nachbarn vibrieren, oberhalb Getrampel, diagonal oberhalb Hundegebell & Wettrennen in der Wohnung mit dem Hund, von vorne dann der Glascontainer.
5. Balkon: Markise kaputt. Griff zum Aufmachen abgebrochen + rostig. Markisenstoff zerfleddert, sieht aus wie aus dem Altkleidercontainer. Antennenkabel hängt genau auf Kopfhöhe von links n. rechts mitten durch gesamten Balkon! Meerblick von innen nur in Kombination mit störendem Kabel. Wie im Dritte-Welt-Land!
6. Ameisen: In der gesamten Küche überall Ameisen. Gehen sogar IN die geschl. Spülmaschine rein. KEINE Lebensmittel außerhalb Mikrowelle / Kühlschrank lagern, sie kommen überall ran!
7. Einrichtung: Sessel abgenutzt, 0 Kleiderhaken, Regale Bad wackelig, fingerdicke Staubschicht auf Ventilator, Balkontisch total verdreckt
8. VM nach Mängelanzeige, wir sollen Whg. sofort verlassen oder ab sofort den Mund halten"

Pictures are deceiving to the actual property (pictures were enhanced for false advertisement). When we got to the property a lot of things were broken and in our way and stayed like that until we left because maintenance didn't take with. Maintenance was still working there pass 4pm check in time until about 5:30pm. We had issues with the key and code at the beginning. Cockroaches and bugs everywhere at night and during the day, yes there was no food on the counter when they came out, no WIFI, someone changed the name to it so no Wi-Fi and I had to go to the nearest Starbucks to do my college schoolwork. No laundry card as promised, our laundry unit on the 14th floor was closed due to repair, no cleaning supplies or typical things that are suppose to be provided to keep the place neat, we had to buy it ourselves. Mold and rust in the bathroom and other places. There was more that I didn't mention. We were changed a lot for a blow up mattress that was described as an extra bed. You are charged an enormous cleaning fee $$, not sure for what because our place wasn't even that clean (we left it cleaner than when we arrived to it). Very old property, very outdated, even the guys who run the place say that everything else is updated
and this is the only place that isn't up to date and the host that runs it doesn't care. First Aid kit isn't even up to standard, fire extinguisher was not secured. The first couple of days only 1 elevator worked so we had to carry all our luggage by stairs (14 flights). We were required to do our own dishes upon leaving which I didn't have an issue with besides it not being properly sanitary for the next people to come or for those who were here before us, how do we know that it was actually done sanitary up to code for people not to get sick or diseases. I sent the message to the host requesting a refund and informing of the issue, but the host didn't even have a decency to reply back or acknowledge her mistakes. Stove is outdated same as the fridge. We tried getting another hotel the second night we were there but we couldn't get anything due to it being booked out and we paid around way too much $$ for a week, way overcharged. I could have gotten a Hilton property for cheaper than that."

The unit was easy to find and the area was very nice. When we first checked in, we noticed no welcome booklet so we figured out the wifi/tv ourselves. We had to message the villa manager for the pool access code. The welcome nuts and chocolates were nice. The dryer was broken and stayed broken the entire stay. Previous reviews mentioned beach items but we did not see any except for some beach towels, which were tossed in a pile on top of the washing machine. (not sure if they were clean or dirty but since they weren't folded, I'm assuming they were dirty.) The biggest issue was the cockroach infestation. There were MANY in the kitchen/dining area. They were crawling in the dishwasher, on the dishes, on the floor, over the stove, day and night, every day of our stay. I messaged the owner and the villa manager about the cockroaches and the dryer but nothing was resolved. The owner did reply letting us know the last pest treatment was on November 30th but it obviously didn't have the effect it should have. After a few days, we stopped cooking in the kitchen altogether as it was unhygienic and stressful. We spoke to the downstairs neighbour who said she was also having a similar pest problem and that it was pretty bad this season. They were German cockroaches which are famous for being quite difficult to get rid of. Thankfully we didn't bring any home with us which I was worried about. Besides these issues, the place was spacious and the view was lovely."
