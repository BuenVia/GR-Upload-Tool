This property had a lot of positives. The location was nice. Good neighborhood. Garage parking. Full washer and dryer. Wall A/C units. Plenty of space. Great views. Host communicated all requirements clearly and in a timely manner.

It also had some issues. Spiderwebs on just about every ceiling, with spiders. I had to kill and clear one above the master bed before we could sleep. The house gives off an “unfinished” vibe. There are open holes/outlets with wires sticking out. Like there used to be a tv or sound system wired, but it’s a lot of wires. One of the water faucets, the top came off if you pulled on it to turn on the water. All of this added up to a very cheap feeling for the house and I felt not worth the money. I paid $730 NZD/night. 

Also, and this is just more of an oddity, there are so many light switches and either we couldn’t figure them all out or some of them don’t work. Like, more light switches than ever I’ve seen in a house."
