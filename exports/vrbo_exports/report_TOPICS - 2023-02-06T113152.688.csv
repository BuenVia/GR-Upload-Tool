The check-in process, with Javier (PVRPV) was flawless, despite our late arrival (thank you, Volaris). The unit was clean and fully furnished, and the view from the balcony/patio really nice.

The only negatives were mostly beyond the owners control: way too few outlets (only 2 in the kitchen and none near the counter where one might use a laptop); slippery tiles by the pool; inconsistent maid service (we found towels in the dryer, despite being there 8 nights the sheets were not changed, and we were left to fold the towels after the maid service during the week). We found the cupboards too high, by Javier acquired a step stool (gracias), and the unit could use more towel hooks in the bathrooms (an easy Home Depot fix).

All of the appliances worked really well, and the unit did not lack for any. We found music on the TV system by accessing YouTube via the Roku. We found an extension cord, which we used in the kitchen for a 3rd outlet - a great fix). The beds were very comfortable, the pillows great too, and the A/C units were both easy to use and very efficient.

All-in-all, a great stay - thank you so much for sharing your condo with us. ATBster"

Unfortunately for families with children, this condo complex is geared more towards retirees with many rules restricting activities and encouraging quiet on the property. Normally not a big deal to comply with, however there were several days during our stay when ocean conditions were not safe so we were unable to use the pool and grassy areas on property as a backup activity plan. 

Luckily Maui has many options to keep kiddos occupied but I wish the listing would have been more clear about the on property restrictions that could impact families traveling with small children."

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Again, my review: 0/10"

The view & location were excellent. There was NEVER a shortage of towels, for both bathrooms & the pool. Nice job there!
There were a few minor things that the owner should fix when you are paying $4,000+ for a week. 
The sliding pocket door leading to bathroom in master bedroom needs leveled. 
Most of the sliding doors leading to the pool deck need to be lubricated; easy for adults to slide but not seniors. 
The light in the laundry room needs a new ballast, takes forever to come on at times. The clothes dryer takes too long to dry a simple load of towels.
The AC unit in the master bedroom needs recharged/serviced. We set to 70 degrees & it never went below 73 for an entire week. 
The handle in the master bedroom sink came right off in our hands. Simple plastic piece underneath broke off. 
The other sink in the BR had cold handle faucet that wouldn't turn off. It would just spin around. So you had to have it just right for the water to stop. 
The toilet in the other bathroom leaked slowly onto the floor. 
The garage door opener worked but it wouldn't engage the door itself. In other words, we couldn't use the garage. When it was 80+ degrees, would have been nice to get the cars out of the sun. 
So all of the above were minor in nature & owner needs to address but nothing that we were so upset with that we needed a service call. It's the little things in life that we didn't stress over. But these things need to be fixed. 
Finally we come to the pool & the hot tub. When we arrived, the water level in the pool was approx. 12-15"" low. Low enough in fact that the pool would not heat because it fell below the skimmer. There were garden hoses on either side of the pool which we used to refill the water. Took a good number of hours to refill that much water and get the heater to come on. 
The hot tub was also about 8-9"" low. Since it only held 4 people, fast to refill. 
But we learned that you cannot heat the pool & the hot tub at the same time. Maybe that is how all pool heaters work, but it was a pain to heat the pool for hours, then we had to turn that off & then heat the HT.
Finally every morning we had to refill the HT. It was bone-dry. The pump would come on and shoot water everywhere. We had to refill that everyday. That was a terrible inconvenience.
Lastly, there are ungodly amount of light switches. It would be nice to label them ALL. 
Nice visit but has to be better than this for the cost"

My only personal complaint was the requirement to wash / dry all the towels before we left. With 4 kids it was a bit hectic and we had to time an early morning final swim to have enough time to launder all the towels. Everyone with kids knows one trip to the pool is 6 pool towels and then 6 bath towels so even though there is adequate towels it’s 2 loads of laundry just in towels which takes some time.

The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool."

All the necessary utensils and cookware to cook for our family and even for baking a cake for my wife’s birthday. 
The bed was very comfortable and they kids enjoyed the pullout sofa. This place has 3 pullout sofas and a bed. So you have a lot of sleeping options. There is also 3 big screen tv’s, one in each room. More than enough towels and paper products for a family of 4 for 4 nights. Has a nice view of the pool and hot tubs and it was nice to see the steam coming off the water as the snow fell. It can get pretty windy at the top of snowshoe and we have stayed in other units where you didn’t want to go out on the balcony. But this unit’s balcony is somewhat protected by the winds. If your looking for a place in snowshoe, Allegheny is the best place to stay!! They have 2 hot tubs and a heated pool, cheat mountain pizza is located in the bottom of the building, ski lockers, nice lobby with a tv and fireplace, free entry to split rock (pool/hot tubs/kids water slides), 1 min walk, great location at one end of the village and your right there at the top of ballhooter lift.

From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.
You will enjoy your stay at the Nokomis pool house."

We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic.

Property: If I owned the place then the property manager would be fired instantly. There were bent frying pans, all the knifes are dull, no dishwasher detergent provided, etc. Most of the extra storage closets are locked so storing skis & boards is difficult without being crammed. The place overall feels very dated, the pictures make it look much nicer. Rooms were a decent size & beds are were comfortable but that’s about the extent of the good things. If you want to hot tub after, you’ll need to drive. 

Complex: This is the only place I’ve ever stayed at that doesn’t allow drinks (including water, which is a safety hazard IMO) into the hot tub area. I understand glass but having a beer in the tub after skiing all day is a staple for most people. There’s literally a guy checking as you enter the lobby to make sure you don’t have any drinks, and won’t even allow you to bring water to the locker room. He also closed down earlier than advertised so make sure to get there early. It felt more like being at church summer camp than on a ski vacation. Location is decent though, short drive to the lake & about 30 mins to the slopes.
