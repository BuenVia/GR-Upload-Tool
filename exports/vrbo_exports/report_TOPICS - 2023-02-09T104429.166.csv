Neighbors were friendly. They sent someone to repair a fallen towel bar that a prior guest had toppled. Plenty of dishes. It is an older property though. The front is a bit difficult if you have ambulatory issues. I fell on the step up to the door which is detached from the house and tripped numerous times on the walkway to the house which has several large cracks . My husband stubbed his toe on the same area. Windows don’t close all the way and basement had a definite odor so I could not use it. It does have a ton of space if you can overlook these issues.

Beautiful views from all windows. It was very clean when we arrived. The kitchen would benefit from more utensils and mixing bowls. We were washing the dishes in the evening but didn't have enough teaspoons etc to last throughout the day. The fridge stopped working upon our arrival and they brought a mini fridge which was not enough for all our food. The agency was very understanding and supplied the second mini fridge within few hours. The fans in the rooms were very useful as well as AC. Pool was wonderful. The only problem was the sun umbrella which was not sufficiently secured and the wind tipped it over when I opened it. I fell over the little desk when I tried to catch it and stop it from falling on my little boy. But those were minor issues and we were very pleased with our stay overall. My kids had fun and we would gladly visit again."

The Living-room isn’t large enough for 5 people. There were broken items in the home and when I attempted to call to communicate Justin did not answers Justin only answered when I first arrived and when I left. Steps were not salted and had ice where I slipped multiple times. I fell on a broken kitchen chair and bumped my head as well as other family members. Don’t stay here as the practices are unfair."

The views was lovely. I called and called about one of the balcony chairs had just fell apart while I was sitting in it. I had to go to the urgent care because I hurt my lower back and right wrist. I called and called NO ANSWER so I sent an email and still NOTHING

The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!"

My wife has mobility difficulties because of back injuries, and she found the stairs hard to climb. This is NOT William's fault - we should have asked more questions! Kitchen equipment was excellent. Justin was very helpful. We did not have wifi or phone connections in Costa Rica. We did not receive instructions on how to check in to the property before we arrived at the address, but we met up with Jus within a few minutes of visiting the Coastal Property Management office."
