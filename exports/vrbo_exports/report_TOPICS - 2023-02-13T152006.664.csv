We were stuck w/ hours of no water in the bathrooms until night after a 4hr road trip to get here. The only irresponsible solve the host gave us was to walk for a full refund WTH! We had to sort this ourselves w/ Northstar security after hours, glad this wasn’t a gas leak. Such crappy service for that $$$. Stay away & look for some place / host that cares & is hospitable."

The condo was larger than we thought and the quiet location was everything we expected and more. It is walking distance to many restaurants, and there were 2 grocery stores near by. We found the one store that was a little further of a walk (5 minutes vs 2) to be a better value. 
The beach was quiet and we enjoyed a daily morning walk. Everyone was friendly in the area and we felt safe our entire trip. 
Krain was amazing from the get go. Our private shuttle driver Milton, was exceptional. He stopped so we could see monkeys and pointed out other sights on the drive. The property management dealt with a leaking a/c the morning we discovered the leak and brought us a new propane tank when we ran out. We couldn't have asked for better service."

It will accommodate 6 however. There were some nice beach chairs and flotation devices supplied in the shed across the street by the canal which was handy. Easy check in and out. The grill connection to the propane bottle has a gas leak but otherwise everything worked very well. There is a nice patio on the ground floor which i understand well be becoming a swimming pool soon, but the best view is from the wrapm around deck upstairs. wished it had better tv channel selection, but if you can bring you access from your tv at home, you can use Hulu, netflix, sling, etc. Overall we had a great time and would recommend this host and the property."

The house itself is in a nice community, and very well located for access to expressways to take us anywhere in the LA area.
It was such a large house that it could accommodate our whole family. The hot water was plentiful once it got through the pipes. The table and chairs in the dining room were at normal height, thankfully, not hightop. The TV was really large. The washer and dryer were used a lot, with all of us, and they worked well. Beds were very low and soft.
Gas leak was detected. We contacted the landlord, and the employee switched our faulty stove with another stove from a nearby rental that was empty. We were concerned about that stove in another rental in future weeks.
The soft-cushioned, white leather couch was badly grimed with dirt, and therefore, not sanitary, especially for our toddler.
The first load of dishes showed the dishwasher incapable of cleaning the dishes; and thereafter, dishes had to be hand-washed.
The weekly cleaning was well-done with care by the cleaners, concerned that we had sufficient clean blankets, etc. Under the couch, between the cushions, behind the appliances, and edges of the floor near the walls, had not been thoroughly cleaned recently.
Decide for yourselves if you wish to take the chance for soft, low furnishings and if the problems have been fixed."

Kitchen was well stocked, lots of dishes, cutlery, bowls, pots and pans. The covered Lanai was spaciousness, nice chairs, dining table and chairs for six, enjoyed the beautiful sunsets and cool breezes. As advertised the house is right on the ocean and because of this the noise from the ocean crashing on the rocks is constant, some people may find this annoying. There is A/C thru out so bedrooms could be kept at a good temperature. The Bar-B-Q needs some work, one of the controls does not turn the gas off so unless tank is turned off gas keeps leaking out, also it had not been cleaned in a long while until we cleaned it.
All in all a very nice place, lots of pool noodles,and beach chairs and snorkelling equipment."

We were given 2 choices as a replacement. We did not like the choices but took the Cabin on Hackberry instead of the other place because of stairs at the other place. We think we should have been given the opportunity to reschedule at our original choice at another date. We left a day early due to the weather and the location and the layout of the replacement property. We think you should give us a credit for use at the property we wanted at another time.
