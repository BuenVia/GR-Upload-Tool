Excellent views and quiet neighborhood. Close drive to the ocean. Kitchen had everything that we needed, bedrooms all had tv's and comfortable beds. Excellent communication with owner and property manager. We were assured that the house would be ready for us as I had voiced my concerns about the fact that there were no photos of the interior on the website. There were a few unfinished items like wires hanging from the ceiling, and water not turned on to the dishwasher or washing machine which we needed to problem solve. The home is filled with floor to ceiling windows. Our son's bedroom was so bright and hot in the morning that he would wake up early and come into our room. Window coverings will help with this issue. Also, window coverings in the master bath and closet would be helpful, as I needed to keep the lights off so the neighbors would not be frightened when looking up. The pool water is cold and we had thought that there was a jacuzzi that would at least be warm. However, the jacuzzi only has jets, NO HEAT. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your home, we had a wonderful vacation!"

It was an anniversary getaway. So, I trusted that it would be a good experience. The unit that we were in had some major hiccups. But overall, it was a good weekend and a good getaway. If I stay there again, it won't be in Seahorse 2-B unless the major issues are fixed! It was a comedy of errors!

The issues: 
1. Inadequate heating. 
this was a major issue, in that the gas fireplace stopped working on our second night. The gas fireplace was the only source of heat for the large living room area. The property manager (who is stellar and the major reason why I didn't give this review a low rating!) came out after 9:30 p.m. at night, after I had been communicating with Vacasa for 1.5 hours with no success (I think I was talking to a robot). The property manager identified that the gas fireplace was not safe, after he had attempted to fix it (the odor of the gas was strong), and said he would bring a space heater by in the morning. We used a gas oven to heat the living room. Luckily there was a cadet heater in the bedroom, so we didn't freeze. he brought out a space heater the next day, and it served us well for the next two nights. The housekeepers and property managers were excellent in their response! I hope that they are paid well. The senior house keeper brought by extra blankets and communicated with us throughout the lack of heating. She suggested using the oven to heat the room, which turned out great! It felt like a fancy camping trip, but I had forgotten to bring any marshmallows to roast.

2. There is exposed wiring behind the refrigerator. No outlet plate cover. This is an easy fix. 
3. The outlet in the bathroom, beside the bathroom sink, is not grounded. Again, an easy fix.
4. Molding is being held together with masking tape. 
5. The IKEA dining chairs need to be repaired and tightened. They were very rickety.
6. The sofa has unstitched upholstery that needs repair. 
7. it wouldn't hurt to have calking around the windows, as we could feel the high winds. 
8. A brighter light bulb in the bathroom would be nice. 
9. Coat Hooks! There is absolutely no place to hang clothing in this unit. It would be a beautiful use of space if about 8 coat hooks were installed in the hallway. 

I'm giving a huge shoutout to Anita, Tim, and Nathan, who were stellar in their support! The property managers and housekeeping staff are amazing!"

They were long black hair strands throughout the house. They were exposed wires on the living room floor, which I have no idea what they were. The heating is atrocious, part of the house is burning hot, and the rest is freezing . Vacasa is the worst management, and. I did a review and they will not post it every time you call Vacasa you get a different person from.

We vacated 2 days early due to poor conditions. 
The entrance was at the back, was dark, cluttered & had a crumbling cement stairs. Out front had bags of garbage and toilets to be disposed of for two days after we arrived. The living room had poor lighting, had missing bulbs & the room was still dark after they replaced a bulb. It was too dark to read a book without a flashlight. One sconce was hanging by wires off the wall. The floor was unfinished between the kitchen & living room causing a tripping hazard. The kitchen light didn't work causing us to have to use our cell phone flashlights to see. One hall light flickered the whole time it was on. The noisy sliding BR doors were very hard to open and close. There were no closets or hooks anywhere to hang clothes in the bedrooms or the entrance to hang a coat. There wasn't enough hot water to take a ""quick"" shower. The windows had bars, ""not pictured"" on the listing. The windows and curtains were filthy. The kitchen counters and coffee pot had not been cleaned. The kitchen had water stained & sagging ceiling tiles. We would, periodically, smell sewer gas.
We did communicate with the manager during our stay. They did address replacing a couple light bulbs, however, the rooms remained dark and no light in the kitchen. She was sending our complaint with pictures we took, to the owner however, we have not heard anything back from the owner even 5 days later which is careless on his part. We regret that we paid $896.57 for 5 nights."

We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

The property manger told us the pool was heated and it wasn’t…. The house had exposed electrical wires both inside and out.

After two hours on the phone with VRBO we were able to get some of our money back for the other two nights.

There are always some quirks with buildings that are as old and historic as these. I have never had a complaint or a bad experience until this time. 

The troubles started at check in. VRBO sent me an email with the apartment number and a door code. The owner sent me a text with a different apartment number and a different door code. I texted back that VRBO had sent me different information and verified that I should use the VRBO information. When I entered the apartment, there was someone staying there. I then asked the owner if I should go to the other unit, to which they replied I should and asked if I had the code (that they had just sent me). 

I entered that unit and looked around. It was nothing like the photos but I had dinner plans and did not have time to do a thorough inspection. I had some business that evening and the following morning, so I tried to connect to the wifi using the instructions provided. The network name provided did not appear, so I texted the owner. They responded quickly and said that someone would be out that night to repair it. No one ever showed up. I spoke to the occupant of the other unit and he said that he had not had wifi for his time there and was repeatedly told someone would come by to fix it. He was staying for a month and had not seen anyone come to fix it. 

When I returned from dinner I texted that the wifi was still not working and was told ""there is a green light on the box so it is good"" there is no box or a green light and the network name would appear only occasionally. When it did appear the multiple passwords that I was given did not work.

I did a more thorough inspection of the unit on my return. I found the tables and counters were sticky in spots, There was a used washcloth on the kitchen counter, the cabinet doors were on crooked and did not stay closed, the floors, walls, light switches, and shower were filthy. The toilet seat had only one bolt and slid off the stool when sat on, the rear door was duct taped closed but you could see light coming through. There were cords and exposed wires allover the unit. There was broken conduits with the wires exposed, electrical boxes duct taped closed and air conditioners that did not cool the unit down to below 75 degrees after 5 hours.

Everything was as per the description. Very comfortable bedding (thank you), we’ll equipped, calphalon cookware and actually sharp knives! Walking distance to the gondola and can ski back even closer. Shuttle service is very helpful and don’t need a car. Hot tubs were HOT which was great after a day on the slopes. 
Would have gotten 5 stars if not for the following: 
- kitchen lighting is terrible. So poorly lit, makes it feel like you are prepping by the light of a flashlight. 
- One of the bedroom lamps was broken 
- The dishwasher has a lower tray that constantly rolls off the rail, and is so close to the drawer for the trash that you usually can’t open the door because the trash door hasn’t closed completely. 
- Toilet in the master would teeter when sitting on it. 
- Smoke detector dangling from wires in the hallway. 
- Shuttle service is very slow. While they will take you anywhere, when they say 15-20 min, expect more like 30 min. Still, cheaper than an Uber. 
- can hear neighbors upstairs, but not intrusive 
Overall though, it was a great place to stay and I would recommend it."

We enjoyed our long weekend getaway with family and friends. The house does need some maintenance (door handles loose, broken doors on the downstairs entrainment center and dresser in master bedroom, and all the wall electrical plugs were all loose. Also the grill was rusted and in bad shape.. yes we did grill while visiting after having to get a grill cleaning kit). 

As far as Massanutten resort- wish I could say we enjoyed it but that is not the case. Purchasing tickets for snow sports is extremely difficult. Also- the Saturday we were there, a private rental closed the mini golf, GoKarts, and other activities. Not ideal in peak winter season. The slopes were so packed and just all around not the best experience of the resort itself.
The property served its purpose but we will not be returning to Massanutten Resort.

Nothing major, just dated and a little dingy, dings in the walls, old carpet, chipping floor in shower.

It’s nothing fancy, and has several issues, but it is clean and well supplied. 

 The resort is very nice. And the location is close to many places of interest. 

We had some difficulty and confusion at check in. The key is in a lock box that we struggled to get I open Once we did get into it we tried to open the door that the box was hanging from, but it would not open. We then discovered the key fit the sliding door. Small thing, but it was kind of frustrating after a day of travel. Then it became clear that the other door was another room that we did not have access to. Not a big deal, just would have liked to know this before hand. Nice backyard that we did not get to use because we were only there a short time. The small front porch had overgrown vines and dirty chairs. There was rain recently so maybe the host had not had a chance to clean them yet. 

If you’re just needing a place to land at night and don’t need luxury accommodations, this will be fine. It’s not fancy. There’s an unsightly tangle of wires hanging below the television. And using the television was confusing. If you’re cooking you have to step into the hallway in order to get into the refrigerator. The binder with information was just three pages and was not a great help. 

It was just ok."

This house was DIRTY. I am talking cob webs everywhere, food crumbs everywhere, dead bugs all over.. hair from previous renters… linens smelled like body musk, kitchen was dirty and pots and pans and utensils were all dirty… . It was bad. When we arrived and saw this, I immediately called owner and she was very quick to respond but was surprised that the house was dirty. She said she never had this issue and that the last time the house had any guest was a few months ago… and that’s the last time the house had been cleaned. In my opinion and if I was in her shoes and I knew I had guest coming I would have the house cleaned!!!!!!!! I do have to say that the owner did send the cleaning lady to see the house but when she arrived all she said was that she cleaned and did her job and there was nothing else she could do. She offered Lysol for me to spray on the linens….. LOL!!! Then I called the owner and she offered to refund us 2 nights for the dirty house. By the time it was time for bed we noticed there was NO hot water… oh my god. NO hot water in January!!!!! We tried everything and couldn’t fix it… So again called the owner and she said her parents had went to turn the hot water off so the pipes wouldn’t freeze a few months ago.. (she failed to inform us of this before check in) she also said they had put antifreeze in toilets so the water wouldn’t freeze (what in the world???) she said she would call the plumber in the morning… so that night we had no hot water and had to boil some water for the kids to take a bath. The plumber did not show up till after 3pm… 
Thankfully he was able to fix it but he did say the way the lines and wires are in the front of the house was weird and dangerous… also all the beds were SUPER loud and old… this house definitely needs some maintenance and DEEP cleaning!!! These are just things a paying guest should not have to worry about. Period. The rest of our stay was just ugh. We had to stick it out because we came from Puerto Rico and my family came from New York and Raleigh and we had no where to go… the only up side was the out side… loved it!!!! The kayaking and the swing was nice! We did enjoy that and the fire pit! The house was awful and could not recommend."

Unsafe lights above kitchen sink broken bases of bulbs in 2 sockets . Lights flickering.
Not that expensive or challenging to replace those fixtures with led fixtures 
Stairwell lights didn’t work and created an unsafe walkway. I am not paying to replace bulbs in fixtures I can’t even open. 
No broom!
Nail protruding on step I found a hammer and was able to hit it in. 
Glass table legs move and the glass top is very heavy and unsafe
Smoke alarm wires hanging in entry way and no alarm.
Curtains didn’t fully cover the windows.
Great location but the place needs an upgrade especially lighting and other items listed above."

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again."

We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here."

It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had.

The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them.

The home was dirty, windows didn’t close, door/window screens littered with holes, electrical wiring was exposed throughout the home. Both the front and back doors don’t completely close, a quarter inch gap exists to let the light and bugs through. Broken tile and holes in the wall throughout the home. The bathroom tiling was so shoddy that the owner didn’t bother to tile underneath the vanity which stood on four legs and thus exposing the floor boards. The pool area was filthy, the decomposing solar cover littered the pool with plastic. Think twice before booking."
