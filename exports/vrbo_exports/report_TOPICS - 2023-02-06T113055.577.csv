The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, note it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children under 6.

Also for the high cost for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests. We have also provided more details to the owners direct to ensure a positive guest experience and with some amends are sure the home will continue to improve in its standards."

Refrigerator ran well, good air-conditioner. Plenty of hot water. For the price it's a good deal. We arrived late at night. The unit is on the third left upon entering the property not the second so it took awhile to find. Inaccurate arrival directions. The bed is high off the ground and is super soft. Slippery shower needs a non skid mat. Consider the price....Worth it."

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone."

Issues with getting access to house when we arrived and did not receive timely response from property management company regarding power outage on 1st day of our stay.

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and the Unit had no Wi-Fi !
Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote but NO Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager."

My friends and I rent houses every year and I guess have been lucky with good experiences. This was a very disappointing experience however there was nothing that could be done in the moment so we did not bring these matters up with the host at the time.

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps."

Everything was in working condition.The bed could be replaced, its was lumpy in the middle, like the mattress would bunch up. The couch is very uncomfortable, its a lounger and is hard to get out of, they need to put some lamps and end tables in the living room so you don't have to sit in the dark, yes, there are overhead lights but who wants to sit with those bright lights on. There is no information book for renters on how to use things, hard to figure out the TV with out instructions. Also they could replace the tub with a walk in shower, that is one of the dangerous tubs we have every used and no grab bars in case you lose your balance. The other thing we were disappointed about was that the pool was not heated, guess it has been out since the last hurricane, too bad the host didn't inform us of this, also there was no outdoor seating, as was shown in the pictures.

Best view ever. The view compensated for the few issues we had. 
Plumbing( one sink plugged and leaking). We had other sinks so we managed. 
The jet tubs ( one did not work) the other we had a issue as well, 
One toilet needed repairs.
Turned off pump for the waterfall, after calling about noise etc. to the manager.
2 of 4 safe boxes not accessible. One lost key and the other a battery needed.
Main kitchen sink faucet plugged ( Edgar came to check it out).
During one yard cleaning there was a problem with a sewer smell.
Pool light out. It was repaired.
We are a clean group, did not opt for cleaning service. But tried to maintain cleanliness during our stay. The 2 mops were were discussting. 
A few tips for future renters:
Slip mats in bath rooms(for older renters (seniors ) or someone with disabilities
Slip free rug at the entrance and exits of the pool. My aunt ( senior) only entered the pool once because of the fear of falls.
A pail and good mop for those who like to sweep and mop during their stay.
Cleaning supplies too. 
A special thanks to Edgar! He was very knowledgeable about where to go . We brought inflatable’s to use for our stay, he got us a pump to blow them all. 
I know Zendis does not own all the homes surrounded the beautiful home we rented. The only thing making it perfect was the loud barks of the old big dogs in the am and the little dog yapping too.

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children.

However, for the high cost of $6,000 for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests."

Property Highlights: The clean pool, the jetty you could walk out to see sunrise/ sunsets, plenty of outdoor seating in and out of the sun. Lagoon is full of beautiful fish and lobster. Bought a snorkel mask at Walgreens (a short bike ride away). Clean, friendly Security at Gatehouse and Grounds Staff do a great job keeping things garbage free and tidy.

The “However…”s BIG THiNG: (Condo itself) the ground floor level has a step up to the landing and bedroom, then you turn to go up to the main level. Coming back DOWN, turn on the landing, open door into downstairs living room and there’s a STEP DOWN that I missed twice, and my mother actually fell. It’s just a regular step down in the same color tile that needs a sign, or yellow/red tape on the ground level. I had a laundry basket in my hand so stumbled down into the room and caught myself. My mom fell down and caught herself on the pullout couch bar and we spent the day at the hospital. EASY FIX, I am writing to the owners. I just don’t want someone else’s vacation to be spent at Mariner’s (GREAT little hospital and EMS and ER staff!) I pray you don’t need it. It was 100% avoidable.

The stairs are steep and narrow. Anyone with knee/ ambulatory issues ((or big feet!) should just put up the money and go stay at the Mariner’s Club as their condos are one-floor living (and gorgeous-my sister stayed there). 

The third floor patio was missing a screened panel, but I am assuming it’s from a recent storm and on the To Do list as the gnats came out in the evening, and there was a paper wasp nest above it so anyone with a bee allergy would have been concerned. 

Tiny things: Two shower doors didn’t have plastic/rubber dams so water came out under the door which is no big deal EXCEPT when someone is more susceptible to a slipping hazard.

Property (not condo itself) The walkway lamp light was out so it made traversing the outdoor stairs from main floor patio to lagoon walkway difficult (we used cell phone light but I was still not the safest)"

We were attending a conference in downtown Atlanta & this was within a 10 min drive & was large enough for our group. You can tell they have put work into the property & it's not a bad place today. We even talked about possibly staying there again.

The Bad: 3 leaks in the ceiling, under furniture was gross, inside door closing issues, wet/slippery bathroom floors, dryer was SUPER squeaky, water seeping in under exterior back door, etc.

The UGLY: 3 of our people arrived early, 2 of them being police officers. When they arrived 1 of them sat on a wicker chair, and it collapsed. Then during the evening someone simply sat on another wicker chair, and it collopased. There was no horseplay or anything rough with them. They simply sat down and the broke & the corn hole board I leaned up against a wall & a leg broke. I tried to contact the owner to try & tell him some of the issues we had & explain the chair to try and help him as we were some of his first renters but he was not wiling to talk to me on the phone-& the list was long enough I was not going to sit there and text him. He then proceeded to charge me over 500$ in damages. I tried to speak w/ him but he wasn't willing to communicate.

If they can fix the leaks & have actual beds(not air mattresses) for people this is a great place. But be aware, they will charge you for anything and not speak to you about your stay."

We had a small issue with the lockbox for the key, but the property manager arrived quickly to assist. Mark was responsive throughout the process. We had elderly people in our party, so the showers were too slippery for them. I'd recommend adding something to the bottom of the tubs or a sticky mat to make that less dangerous."

 The keyless entry is really a brilliant idea! The apartment is just as described in the ad. We are walkers and had no trouble walking to H Street where we found restaurants, Whole Foods Market, plus free transport to Union Station. We did use Uber for the first time and loved it - DC is super-tricky to drive around (for us), so it was a great choice.
The bed was a semi-firm memory foam mattress, very comfortable and the shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower floor was a little slippery so I put down a kitchen towel for safety - it was great, otherwise! There was plenty of streaming channels on tv, and we had no trouble with the WIFI. We highly recommend this apartment and would stay here again!"

My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

I fell in and was hurt and it ruined my entire trip. Railing or complete removal of this tub should be done. I have brusied left leg, sprain right ankle and bruised right ribs. we arrived at the home all the lock box codes were wrong the housekeeper forgot to put in new codes for us. we get a call from the owner that the day we were to leave was 1/23 and that we were still in the house on on 1/24 according to the housekeeper. We left the house at 9:00 am on 1/23 to our other rental in Kona. 10 days later the owner called and said that we stained the carpet. The carpet had stains from all over the carpet on our arrival on 1/17. I have been to the big island +10 times and this is the worst home we have rented it destroyed my vacation. That bathroom sunken tile tub is dangerous even if its lighted or dark. This could be very good rental if the owners would correct some safety issues, a fall into this tub could kill someone if they hit their head. I was hurt but I also was very lucky it could of been alot worst
