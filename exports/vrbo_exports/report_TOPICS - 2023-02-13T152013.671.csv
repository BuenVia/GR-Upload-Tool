We loved that we could sit outside and watch wildlife on the canal. Beautiful view. Unfortunately, the outside furniture was extremely dirty and moldy. We had to put a sheet over the cushion on the loveseat. The table had to be washed too. The deck was not safe and needed to be replaced. Fenced yard was great for the dog. 
We loved the house. It was roomy and comfortable. 
Inside was clean for the most part but I accidentally stuck my hand in grease left on the stove. Rug in master bed room has a corner the sticking up and is a trip hazard. Complain about it the 1st day and reminded them several times by text and email but it was 2 weeks before it was taped down. 
The neighborhood was good. Well maintained. House located on a court so no traffic. There was a unlicensed broken down car right next to the driveway that made it more difficult to back out of it. We were excited to have a garage but couldn’t use it due to the fact that it was full of stuff. It shouldn’t even be mentioned in the listing if you can’t park in it. 
We were there 3 weeks. We paid for a month but the day before we were leaving, my brother pasted away so we totally lost a whole week’s rent. Vrbo does not take into consideration the loss of an immediate family member."

The pool was so nice to have, a little cold but we were there in the off season. The house is located in a nice neighborhood, unfortunately the views are obstructing because of the condominiums surrounding the house. 
A few points of concern: The hot water heater is set way too high. The water was scolding hot, this might not be a concern for anyone else but we have small kids who might have burned themselves. 
The second concerning safety issue was that a small section of the upper part of the deck railing is not to code and the slats are too far apart. My toddler was able to stick her head and shoulders thru the slats. 
Other than those things it was a great place to stay!"

This unit should not be listed to rent until this construction is over !!! It is actually a fire hazard and dangerous plus there is no access to the beach or to the pools or hot tubs or the major pretty balcony that's described on the listing. I'm sure it is great when there is no construction going on but the balcony was literally boarded off you could not step out into the balcony and if there was a fire outside the unit we were locked in. Don't get me wrong this would be a great location and place if this was not currently going on !!! And I understand that during the off season this needs to be done but it needs to be told to people before they rent it I literally had to be moved to another place because of the constant banging people outside of the windows & balcony ..........you could not use any of the amenities and the water coming out of the ice maker was brown. It was not safe. I was moved 2 days after being put in that place which was too long and if I had known one bit of it before I would have never booked.

We loved the Coal coast and will definitely be returning to the area. It was relaxing, beaches great, fantastic walks and uncrowded. Sadly the property is rundown and the pool and deck were unsafe. Rusting steel and unstable decking around pool, dirty stained walls and broken rust in bottom of pool meant we were unable to use the pool at all. Our grandsons were devastated. Deck is also in need of urgent repairs with rotten boards and protruding nails. Outdoor cushions were wet , mouldy and filthy. Internally you could see they had started to work on improving the property but there is still a long way to go. For a $420 cleaning fee I would recommend cleaning windows, laundry sink and cupboard underneath and removing garbage stored in stables. We needed to buy plugs for kitchen sink, squeegee for bathroom floors, water glasses, cling wrap, foil.., Agent did come out to assist when we had problems with lights as they have quirks. We wish the agent well as he is trying to fix problems but it will take owner stepping up. Coal coast is a wonderful holiday destination I would recommend and this is a property that we would love to buy and give it the love and attention it deserves."

The condo had a grill and did not work. The garbage disposal did not work the water got backed up on the sink. The kitchen trash can was dirty. The door on the game room did not want to close. The master bedroom had trouble flushing. Spider and spider web in the ceiling. The kitchen table was a wobbly. The pillows smelled like they haven’t been washed. One chair on the bar was broken it was missing a bolt. The internet was slow. The balcony side rail felt loose and the vertical wood could be move sideways. It needs plenty of repairs.

Hosts provided everything you would need and the place is very nice. Slider was broken when we went (hosts left a message apologizing for inconvenience on slider) so couldn't use the balcony, but it was raining while we were there so that wasn't an issue for us. Parking is basically street parking (just off street, but no gate or anything) so I was a bit concerned about break-ins, but nothing happened while we were there so my concern was for naught. Do pay attention to the ""two flights of stairs"" in the listing though as that was the only part that I wish I had put more thought in to :-). Overall, I would gladly stay here again."
