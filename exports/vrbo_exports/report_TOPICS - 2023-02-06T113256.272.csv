From this spot, we took in St. Augestine, NASA, New Smyrna, Ponce De Leon Lighthouse and beach, the State Parks north of Ormond, etc, etc. Also close enough to do theme parks if that's your jam. The condo unit was clean, well-maintained, and well-appointed. 

Downside was that after the hurricane, almost every Daytona Beach condo had damage to their pool decks and pools. So there was no pool at the condo, and the beach was fenced off the entire time we were there. You had to sneak around fences and gates to access the beach. High tide also made most of the beach unaccessable for several hours. During the day, there was a lot of construction on the beach. It is what it is, but I had no idea the damage was so extensive that far North. This is more an FYI for others who may ve considering this spot for vacation."

Anne Marie was fantastic in communicating the condition and repairs on and around the condo area and because of her we kept our reservation. This condo has so many things going for it. The furnishings are all perfect - clean and in great shape - no wear or stains. The mattress is amazingly comfortable and the sheets are quality! The dishwasher is by far the quietest that we have ever encountered in a rental. The screened in deck showcased fantastic sunrises and had the advantage of shade in the late afternoon. The kitchen was well appointed with nice cookware, dishes and a nice variety of basic spices and coffee. There is not a washer/dryer in the unit but it is a short distance from the condo to the coin machines on the very same floor and detergent is furnished for a load or two. The rainfall shower is wonderful and spacious and there were plenty of amenities for soap/shampoo/conditioners and plenty of clean towels. We did not go to the beach, but there is a great supply of beach items if you choose to go. We did run into a bit of updating that had been delayed due to the hurricane, but it was nothing that the owners had control of and they were so very helpful as we worked our way though that. We had a wonderful and warm week - thank you!"

Unfortunately the ongoing construction, which we were told ahead of our stay would be only a minor disturbance. In fact we found out that the sewage treatment is under repair. When we pulled up to the property for our stay a sewage truck was blocking the parking lot, emptying the sewer lines for the building. The second night, in the middle of the night the stench of sewer gas was so strong in our room that our eyes were watering and our infant began coughing. We had to move onto the sofa near the balcony to sleep. Ultimately do you safety concerns, we had to evacuate the property the next morning, cutting short our week long stay by 5 nights and having to find a hotel at the last minute. We called the property manager to inquire about the overpowering sewer gas smell, and he readily acknowledged that the sewage treatment on the property was broken and was an ongoing issue. We believe that the property should not be rented out to other unsuspecting families until the construction of the sewage handling is completed."

The sounds of the waves, long walks on the beach, and cool breezes were a perfect break between two theme park visits. The interior is just as the photos depict and the kitchen is well-stocked with tea & coffee and the leftovers from previous visitors (don't buy olive oil -- there are at least 3 bottles). 

Hurricane damage washed out the condo's direct access to the water (and the pool is out of order too, not a problem in January) but the beach is accessible via a staircase just a five minute walk away (on 10th).

The host (Beverly Trent) was very responsive to all my questions (first time VRBO). I highly recommend the condo and, if I lived in the region, would stay again."
