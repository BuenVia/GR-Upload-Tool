I don’t even know where to start. How about the sheets on the bed had dried blood/mucus on them? Dried blood was also smeared on the wall of the downstairs bathroom. There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but it wasn’t. Maybe I’m gonna be a hotel person from now on."

Overall, the size of the house was perfect for our family. Amenities were great such as the hot tub, backyard, theater, but the overall cleanliness of the house was filthy. Our socks were black from the carpet and floors, trash was in the closets when we checked in, lots of trash in the garage, light bulbs out and not a lot of kitchen tools to cook things. What was disappointing was the heater stopped working during the night, which that night it got down to 20 degrees outside and the basement temperature was 63. For a child who just barely turned one that is a dangerous temperature to sleep in. Finally after the horrible management communication we were receiving a guy came out to look at the heater. He said it was clogged from something living in the house, maybe a mouse, bird something clogged the furnace, but he got the heater fixed after that. That next night while watching a movie in the theater we caught on camera a mouse in the kitchen. This is extremely dangerous with a child who is crawling and putting things in their mouth. I informed management about our overall stay and they didn’t care. Being a local to Cedar, wanting to support a family with this house so that our whole family could stay together, I would NOT stay here again or recommend to anyone with children. The heater and mouse were the icing on the cake. Very disappointed with our overall stay. Do not use this company or stay at this property unless you don’t care about cleanliness."

No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds. We would have turned around on our first day if we could get a refund! 
As it was we left early."

While spacious with a good open main room and private picturesque setting, it was dirty and unhygienic, had insufficient cooling in the bedrooms, and a serious rat infestation. 
(Normally we give an owner a chance to fix any issues with direct, non-public feedback. This time we made a different decision to be public, to ensure accountability)

When we first arrived there were rat droppings in the living area, the kitchen and the bedrooms. Not sure how this got through “cleaning” as there were both fresh droppings and many that had clearly been there for quite some time. The rats came into the house every evening and left fresh droppings even though we left out no food. The rats repeatedly kept people awake with the noises as they knocked over and chewed non-food items. One evening when one bedroom door was closed the rats visibly chewed the carpets to get out of the bedroom under the doors. There were many unaddressed rat entry points as the ground level flyscreens were all chewed through (when we first arrived we opened the windows at night because there no was working air-conditioning in the bedrooms). After using the BBQ one evening the rats very quickly appeared on the BBQ itself before we had finished our meal (in daylight) – this was the only time that we saw the quite large rats. The owner had known about the rats before we arrived as he warned us about not leaving food out on our arrival day.

The place also had dust in many places including dust that brushed off curtains. There were stained and uncovered doonas, stinky blankets, active cobwebs and dead bugs throughout the living areas and bathrooms. The bathroom needed to be swept of bugs on arrival. Windows were dirty and smeared. This is a build up that the owners haven't bothered to deal with. One evening a cocoon/nest fell from the living room rafters onto the lounge. 

At least two bathroom doors would not latch and just blew open with a gentle breeze or with the rush of air as someone walked past.

A mother and child were stung by wasps, since – as we discovered - there was a large nest in a plant just outside the living room door on the deck. We later discovered another nest near the front door.

One air conditioning unit was broken and the “evaporative air conditioning” for the bedrooms was a complete waste of time."

I don’t even know where to start. How about the sheets on the bed had dried blood/mucus on them? Dried blood was also smeared on the wall of the downstairs bathroom. There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but we paid almost $800/night!"
