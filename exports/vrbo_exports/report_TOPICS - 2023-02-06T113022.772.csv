The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!"

The grounds are kept up perfect. A leaf dare not drop and it is swept up by the hard working gardener. The chef is delightful and made us lunch and dinner every day. You chose what you want on the menu the day before. There were a few miscommunications but all in all it went nicely. There is a helper to serve and bar tend, he was sweet and took great care of our margarita needs. He even led our group on a great hike to a waterfall. One of the highlights of the trip for the grandsons. They jumped off rocks into the river. The housekeeper kept the rooms clean and tidy everyday. My group said it exceeded their expectations and loved being right on the beach and having our own grounds. The boys loved learning to boogie board in the waves and warm sea water. There are boogie boards, pool toys, a ping pong table and kayaks too. Plus they supply life jackets. I loved listening to the waves crashing every night putting me to sleep. I had the window open all night and never needed the AC. I did get bites on my legs as I did not even use a sheet. I think there is a tiny bug called No See UM's. I got bit by those last year in Puerto Vallarta too. They itch like the devil. 
There are a few details that could be tended to. Like hooks on the back of bathroom doors, plastic covers taken off the lamps, a hand rail on the stairs going to the beach. But, those are very minor. You will not regret staying at Casa Mucumba. It is a beautiful."

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone."

I needed to check in a little early and they were able to accommodate which I really appreciated. 
The blankets had some junk on them and because I’m a bit of clean freak I had to put some sheets over them, but it might just have been overlooked since I checked in early. 

Some notes for other guests:
1. The parking is thru a very skinny driveway so do not attempt a full SUV or other extra large vehicle (mini suv or full size sedan is fine)
2. Steps down to the space are a bit steep (and dark at night) and the handrail is unfinished- have a flashlight or phone to see at night and if you have mobility challenges maybe find a different room

The snow plows had come through after they had plowed the parking area, and they did not clean up the mound of snow at the end of the driveway. Our vehicle got stuck trying to get into the parking area, and we had to shovel the ice snow out. Worse than that, they only cleared off the snow on half of the steps, and that half was ice covered with no salt. It was also the side WITHOUT the railing, so there was nothing to hold onto as you climbed 2 stories of very slippery steps. One of my friends ended up falling. There was no salt on the property to help with the situation. We called and requested them to be shoveled and salted that night. No one came to take care of it until 1pm the following day. The back deck with the hot tub was not shoveled at all. We had to shovel it to be able to use the hot tub. There was no propane barbecue on the property, as was advertised. The house was clean except for the grease and animal hair on the waffle maker. The key was supposed to be located “to the right of the door”.

We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before.

However, there were some details that made us wish we had just gotten a hotel. Properties like this are the epitome of the poor STR offerings that are now commonplace.

First: This property is managed by a professional company. It is weird and inconvenient that they require guests to have to first visit an offsite location during their available office hours to check-in.

Second, the amount of messages and forms we were subject to after booking was dizzying. Once we had already booked and paid on VRBO, we were forced to fill out pages of additional forms via links with extra signatures and personal information, and then fill that information again in-person during check-in. They even prompted us to install another additional app altogether just for a 2-night stay. There were house rule sheets fed to us at every turn: in the emails, forms, on printouts, on the contracts, hanging in the home. I felt unwelcome by the end of it. The point is: booking through VRBO should be the sole source of our registration info and the house rules. All this extra stuff felt very unwelcoming.

Third: the home entrance itself was difficult to access. I wish I could post a photo, because the narrow stairs leading to the front door had at least a 3-inch thick later of slippery ice on top. It was almost comical how difficult it was to walk up the steps without assistance. We had to tag-team bringing in our bags because it was so dangerous to walk up. We couldn't have dealt with the ice if we'd wanted: all they provided was a cheap plastic snow shovel that couldn't come close to busting the ice. I can't believe they didn't clear the walkway and salt the steps before admitting guests.

Fourth: the instructions call for guests to take their garbage to the dump, after charging a cleaning fee! As paying guests (and as a short-term rental host myself), I had to laugh that these people require their guests to go run errands for them around town just to go check out. These hosts are a local company -- they can go make the garbage run to the dump themselves.

Needless to say, we won't be coming back to Big Bear anytime soon and I do not recommend Big Bear Vacations."

Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe.

Next the bathroom while it is gorgeous definitely need to be looked at. The sink is entirely to small and there is a strange sewer smell that lingers in the bathroom. The internet was great on my devices but the TV is so old that it can't keep up with the wifi so watching anything that was streamed constantly buffered or flat out got stuck loading. Speaking of the TV half of the TV is darkened and will SOON be out. Next the lighting going down to the property is also dangerous there needs to be more closer to the door. The bamboo on steps needs to be trimmed back, I should not have to walk around it to use the stairs.

Lastly a trash can NEEDS to be added, yes I know you have the tiny trash can big enough for receipts below the sink but that's clearly not enough.

The Good : very beautiful neighborhoods. The furniture in the room was all very well crafted and clean. The studio itself was also very clean. The lighting in the apartment was very nice. The bathroom was very nice for a one person as well. Accessibility to the neighborhood were very easy and great for finding food and other things.

On the first night we were woken up around 1:30 a.m. to what sounded and felt something like a bad earthquake, followed by beep, beep, beep, beep and the process repeated until around 3:30 a.m. Turned out to be snowplows. 
We asked host to give us money back for second night so we could leave, but he would not. Said we knew where the house was located.

The home decor was really unique and fun, and the outdoor space was great to relax in. The huge feature of this house was its proximity to the beach - just a 2 min walk and we had the beach to ourselves at times. Simply beautiful. The guest welcome guide online was great for getting us all the info we needed for check-in and check-out. Communication with the owners was extremely quick prior to our check-in, but once we arrived it slowed down. There were too many items to note for maintenance for me to give this 5 stars. The comforter in the Elton bedroom was stained/dirty, the fan ticked and a phone in the utility closet beeped every two minutes. We also had dust and dead flies under the chairs which we cleaned up. A kitchen drawer was missing the front panel and handle, and the dining room light fixture was missing a glass globe. The bunk room is quite small, as is the black/gold bathroom. There are two steps easily seen from the kitchen down to a door leading outside, but then there's another step beyond that which we all tripped down (it's all black tile) so be careful of that. The pool and hot tub were perfect. The showers in the two larger bathrooms were great. Beds need mattress pads (only a thin sheet between you and the mattress). But the vibe and location to the beach was top notch. I communicated the items that needed to be addressed and did receive an apology and a thanks so they can address for future guests. Unfortunately, it was enough to make the person in the Elton room uncomfortable for the entire stay. Bring bug spray (mosquitos are out). Hoping this home gets a little TLC for future guests."

I reached out via message and asked questions about the hot tub. Explained we were planning a ladies night out. My request said 5. Booking said max overnight 7. Shortly after arriving I received a message about “no unregistered guest”. And “no parties” I responded with it’s just a bunch of us ladies and I told you this is what we were reserving for. I said 2 more may stay and she then said well I have to charge you an additional $20. I mean I had been there an hour. Just trying to relax. All of us 33-50 year old moms!! We work in heath care! We needed to relax! I had to pay an additional $20
Which is just outrageous for the already $411 for the night. This woman does not know how to HOST and should not be a host. Also, the dust in the place was really bad in a ton of spots, the mold in the downstairs shower window was more than I could handle and the freaking hot tub! The reason we ended up with this one smelled terrible! Like mold. The 3 women who went in first came back smelling so bad we couldn’t take it. I have text messages about it the smell still the next day. Really nasty and she just responded with “it was refilled 4 days ago and has chemicals” sure didn’t smell like any chemicals just musty mold! Even the placemats at the table smelled like mold. Bottom line is we picked this house after lots of looking because of the layout. The kitchen, the table and the living room blend together and it was nice for conversation. Pretty and comfortable. I loved the clock. The back porch was cool
With the fire and would be awesome in summer. If you plan to rent this for yourself in town for the night or maybe 2 sure anything else you should expect to be harassed for someone’s past mistakes. Oh and forced to buy the $79 insurance plan that she swears is coming back to
Me. But to me that should have been enough for
Her but no. She needs to stop hosting. I’ll try and submit our messages screenshot for those who might think I’m over reacting 🤣.

The unit was very clean and spacious. The kitchen is well-appointed. They had a water dispenser with large jugs and replaced as needed. Plenty of lounging furniture. The balcony had a table with 4 chairs. I would worn those with children that the spiral staircase to the second floor loft may be a hazard. For adults you must be careful when reaching the top...there are 2 beams you must go under and it's very easy to bump your head. Doable but you must be careful. I don't think there is a remedy due to the design of the unit but just be aware of those that will be sleeping in that area. 

There was a paddle board and two kayaks to use as well as several water toys for children and adults. We didn't use the pool due to the weather but it was kept very clean. The outdoor shower and hose was great to rinse off with. We had a housekeeper come three times for the week and he did a great job including doing the dishes.

We had Chef Beto come in twice. I highly recommend having the welcome dinner. We were tired of travel and it was perfect. Very devious and plentiful! We had leftovers for days!

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen."

The 2 Bedroom unit was larger than expected, well supplied, clean and quiet. The pool area is right outside the Living Room Lanai and noise was not at all an issue when others were using the pool and grilling area, etc...

The step down from the Dining area into to the Living Room has two 4"" steps over an distance of 8 feet wide. We found this to be a concern moving at night without lighting. so we placed one of the Dining Room chairs at the base of the steps to alert us to the steps in the dark.

I had a night cough, so we used both bedrooms and the smaller one seamed to have some type of lingering order we couldn't identify.

The grounds were beautiful and the trail to the beach areas easy to follow. Everything in the description of the property was accurate and we used the beach chairs several times. The refrigerator freezer worked well until the last day when we had to clean out the ice storage bin so fresh ice could be produced,

We also found two of the Coasters were broken in the Living room. We threw them out as they could not be used and purchased a matching set of four coasters which we left for future users.

Overall we would rate the property as a FIVE!"

The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us."

The “floating stairs” in the house are aesthetically cool, but not safe for kids or dogs in my opinion. They aren’t just open at the riser, but they don’t have an attached railing with gaps of several inches between the tread and the wires they used for the railing. We had to carry our dog up and down. Just a small price to pay to reach the beautifully decorated bedrooms and amazing roof top deck. The roof top is another stellar feature and we enjoyed several sunsets up there but had to hold our dog in our lap or keep him on a short leash because the railings are very open.

We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!! 


RENTER BEWARE!!!!!"

We came in for a 1 night stay because I was visiting my sister in Hobby Unit Prison which is 40 min away.
2 hours before we checked in the property manager called me personally to let me know that the unit I originally wanted (The Starling) was having problems with electricity and that the lights were not working.
He gave me the choice of two of treehouses and I chose the CedarWaxling.
All and all I am happy with our stay despite moving cabins. 
It has everything you need , there is no oven but I did see two electrical hot plates under the sink so if you need something hot you can make a small breakfast or lunch.
Has microwave, plates, keirig with coffee pods, plates, glasses and mugs. 
They thought of everything.!!!
Be careful going the stairs and hold the rail because my silly 30 year old behind fell down about 5 steps in slow motion but thank god I have good knees :)
Book it y’all!!! You won’t regret it!
Have a beautiful year!

We were very happy with immediate response when needed help in checking in…and other questions we had. We had a very comfortable staying."

We had three families, each with kids between 1-3. The house was spacious, fun, and the movie room was great! The listing notes that some of the stairs may not be safe for toddlers, but there just happens to be a couple ottoman that were the perfect size to block that stairwell from the younger kids (the 1 year olds). Our 2 & 3 year old could navigate them just fine.

The house was incredibly clean, stylish, and well stocked. We loved it.

Overall, we think this was the perfect house for a short group vacation and would definitely consider booking it again next year if it's available."
