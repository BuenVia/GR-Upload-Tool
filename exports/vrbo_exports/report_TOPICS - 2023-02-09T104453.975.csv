Did not get check in instructions on where to access the property so i ended up unintentionally disturbing the front tenant's who were kind enough to tell me where to go. Upon accessing the studio there was an overwhelming musty smell inside. The studio was tiny (as described) but the bathroom was smaller than imagined. If you are any taller than 5'6 you will have to sit sideways on the toilet or you wont fit because it buts up to the wall. Then as i was getting the pull out bed ready for my son, i seen rodent poop under the cusions. I proceeded to pull it out and found more rodent poop in the bedding. I had to wash all bedding so my son wasnt sleeping in rodent poop and pee. Then as i was stripping the bed i also found other people hair. (Im hoping it was beard hair and NOT pubic) either way NOT how i wanted to start my weekend. I took pics and tried to communicated with the host. Communication was horrible and in the end they said the pics of the poop, hair, dirtyness (and exposed wire) was not enough to issue a refund. Horrible rental!"

And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues."

The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat. The property manager and owner said to leave the bedroom doors open and there are also 2 space heaters to heat the main areas. The space heaters were way to small to make a difference and the main areas were quite cold. None of the living room lights worked nor the living room fan, the pool was filthy, master bedroom faucet was loose, no cable, so no live TV, no garage door transmitters and the shower water pressure was not good. Due to having no heat in the main areas, we would not stay there again. We could look past all of the other issues, but with the main areas too cold to be in, we will look at other properties for our next visit."
