The main issue is that the property has major fire alarm issues leading to the fire alarm going off multiple times on our second night, meaning we got zero sleep. All of our kids were up the entire night and it really made it difficult to enjoy our experience. 

I understand that issues happen, but we have been offered zero compensation or apology from the property management."

We called the unit manager, Jessica Jimenez, who finally got back to us after 20 minutes and gave us the code to the electronic lock. The apartment looked exactly like the images, but was not maintained well. Going out to the balcony, we found a cigarette butt and moving the accent table found it was not cleaned underneath it. The primary bedroom had no closet and the second bedroom had a closet, half fitted with shelves and the other half with a tall chest of drawers leaving 8"" on hanging on either side of the chest of drawers. The kitchen cabinets were very old and dirty... seeing our first roach within minutes of arriving. Good pots and pans, but few pieces of flatware. Baths were decent, but we had to look for bath mats that were dirty, so we washed them. The washer and dryer were very good, but was concerned about the dryer filter since the screen had holes in it and lint was going into the machine..... potential fire hazard. The TV was not working and Jessica kept telling us that the remote had to be connected to the internet. After two weeks of not being able to stream, tech person Saul came to check it out and discovered that the remote was not working. Three days later he returned and hooked up a new remote and we were able to watch TV our last week. While watching TV, we discovered crumbs that had fallen between the cushions and never cleaned up. We have been using VRBO for several years and this is the first horrible experience we have had. DO NOT rent this unit."

It’s quiet and the noise downstairs is not unbearable like I thought it could be (the loudest was the occasional overly drunk person yelling to friends down the street - the sound of happy college kids).

What wasn’t so charming was the rest of the stay and that was solely responsible by who was in charge of the rental (not the apartment or the people). The problem was the apathetic management. 

-We had to call for check-in instructions (usually those come via email and I received them four days after our stay.
-When we arrived, I knocked on the backdoor for someone to move their car so we could park there.
- The pipes were dry emitting sewer gas smells
- The temperature in the apartment was 50 degrees because the heat was off.
- There was no CO or smoke detector (it was laying on a TV stand with the battery out.
- We had to find our own bedding in the apartment and make our own beds
- We had to call for towels (which arrived quickly the next day)
- Trash cans were unlined and we had to find the liners
- The sink was dirty with someone else's shaved whiskers
- The ""goodies"" in the fridge didn't seem safe to eat based on how else everything was 'forgotten' about

It left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I'll eat or sleep there again. Management said they'd try and make it right, but I never heard from them again."

This unit should not be listed to rent until this construction is over !!! It is actually a fire hazard and dangerous plus there is no access to the beach or to the pools or hot tubs or the major pretty balcony that's described on the listing. I'm sure it is great when there is no construction going on but the balcony was literally boarded off you could not step out into the balcony and if there was a fire outside the unit we were locked in. Don't get me wrong this would be a great location and place if this was not currently going on !!! And I understand that during the off season this needs to be done but it needs to be told to people before they rent it I literally had to be moved to another place because of the constant banging people outside of the windows & balcony ..........you could not use any of the amenities and the water coming out of the ice maker was brown. It was not safe. I was moved 2 days after being put in that place which was too long and if I had known one bit of it before I would have never booked.

2 of the 4 guest were assured NO it was taken care of.

The day we arrived received a message from Vacasa saying the roof and lania were damaged. 

The dock was molded looked nothing like the pictures! There were loose boards. They did send someone to clean and stain after we complained.

The pavers going to dock we’re very loose 
Almost fell!! 

Kitchen was NOT equipped with proper utensils 
Rusted knifes in butcher block.
The so called coffee bar is a joke! There are 3 small coffee makers that’s all that’s not a coffee bar!

We had 1 small skillet that was is bad shape! 

We finally got cookware after several days ! 
Th toilet in the 2 bathroom was or had been leaking. 

NO WORKING SMOKE/fire detectors!! 
The beds are VERY hard! 
Pool creeper/cleaner did NOT work 
Screen was missing so pool couldn’t be used! 
Ice maker wasn’t always working!

We received a text saying we had early check in the house was ready…. We arrived 2 hours later 
And the manager and other person was there still getting house ready. 

We said we were disappointed in the property, the manager stated “we were fortunate the house was still there after Ian”

We were clearly lied to by Vacasa! 
After 16 days and many conversations they moved us to a new property! 

The whole vacation was over shadowed and phone conversations and waiting for a response from Vacasa! 

We have pictures of all things stated and more!"

It seems the expectation is that the guest will make themselves available to pack up holiday decorations that filled closets,manage housekeeping, pool maintenance,& plumbers. Issues may arise during a stay but basic maintenance should be addressed between guests - not left for the guests to address. The house was dirty- red splatters on bedroom doors, dirty toilet seat , blankets of dust on mouldings. Red food splatters on kitchen cabinet, backsplash tile and toe kick in kitchen. Scuff marks on walls, moldy caulking in shower. Washing machine was dirty and there were dirty towels in the washing machine when we arrived. Slow sink in the bathroom. 
When I told The host that I felt the cleaning service was stealing her money she became defensive and said they do a wonderful job and that she has been using them for 5 years. 
There were Missing fire alarms. Only 2 in the bedrooms. None in the rest of the house. Broken shades in den. No information about the area attractions, restaurants, grocery store, - although the host was aware that a previous guest had taken the book there was no replacement. Extension cords that are staples to wall used to plug in lamps. 
The 4th bedroom is in the ‘guest cottage’ which would have been fine for us IF it was clean, didn’t smell musty and if people staying in there were able to access the main house at night after the doors to the house were locked. The back door to the yard from the main house didn’t close correctly so they put 2 slide bolts on it. Because of this anyone staying in the guest house would have to exit the yard and walk around to the front door to unlock it with a key. The only other access would be through a bedroom which would be awkward to leave unlocked while people are sleeping in the room. 
The pool heater not on. Had to flip on circuit breaker while being directed by host and program heater-heater not working and pool needed to be shocked .
The AC compressor in the side yard next to back door has fencing around it that is in disrepair and literally fell down every day- very disappointing Major construction going on next door- had to finally leave early bc we couldn’t sit outside from noise and debris coming over the fence. Use your money elsewhere Would not recommend. Area was centrally located to all. Find another house in the same area. You’ll be much happier."

Restaurant and bar close by and the food was pretty good. Be prepared for a bit of a walk getting to the condo- the taxi dropped us off quite a distance from the unit which was unfortunate. 

The bed is soft and super comfy and the condo is equipped with just about everything you’d need to enjoy the water. 

FYI - the smoke detector is went off in the middle of the night for no reason. 

Overall very happy and will be back! Thanks"

While it would have been nice to have a baby gate (or 2) and a crib we had a wonderful time. It was very cozy sitting in the middle of the woods. The oven set off the fire alarm every time we opened it but it was reassuring that they all worked! Greybeard’s management team was very helpful when we came to them with problems.

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again."

There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests.

The pool was great and frequently used. There were a number of not well publicized surprises that would make me think twice before renting the property again:

1. At precisely 9:00 am everyday, daily flight sorties commence overhead with fighter jet training exercises. It is nearly to converse while this is happening.

2. The cooking furnishings are fairly spartan for such a property making it near difficult to cook large meals for a group of six. Things that we would otherwise take for granted like cutting boards, salt/pepper, kitchen towels were not to be found. What was there was very limited relative to other comparably priced VRBO's we have rented previously.

3. The one meal we did cook resulted in 30 minutes of smoke alarm hell. Best we could tell the oven vent is not vented to the outside so any minor smoke set them off. Once tripped, the affected ones had to be individually reset.

4. The outside ceiling fans did not function and one had a broken blade which might explain why they were shut off at the breaker.

Overall, there was a lot to like about the house but enough not to like where I probably would not rent again unless some of the items that are able to be remedied were."

We had a couple of concerns around being unable to get the television to work and the property manager just said they couldn't help with that.

Also the smoke alarm kept going off due to the battery needing replacing so we just took it down and left it on the table inside doorway so others would not experience it going off all night.
My main concern was the inability to get hold of anyone if needed. We had been made homeless due to flooding in auckland the week prior and requested consideration due to the state of emergency declared in auckland. Tried to get hold of the owners for 3 days prior to our holiday to discuss this but no one was able to get hold of anyone. It just would have been nice to have had an answer as to whether a cancelation or deferral of the booking was possible due to the extreme circumstances, but we ended up going as it was too expensive to lose. This is possibly why the niggly thing with the tv not working was a little more annoying than normal as we were already pretty overwhelmed."

We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place. Some of the sheets/comforters were clearly stained with makeup and crusty with what looked like bodily fluids on them... Surely a health and safety concern. The lock on the large TV room door was broken and did not lock. The master bathroom had what looked like puke on the walls. 

Unfortunately, our stay was during record low temperatures, so we had to wear multiple layers of clothing and start a fire to stay warm, however, the damp wood and half-functioning flue caused smoke to fill the home. The downstairs basement bedroom was incredibly cold, with temperatures barely exceeding 55 degrees. Many bedrooms did not have proper window coverings. 
The high foot-traffic areas were also dangerously icy and there was champagne (or some other substance) sprayed on the ceiling in the living room. The dishes in the cabinets were still dirty with lipstick on them and the carpets throughout the house were stained with suspicious-looking fluids, all of which are health and safety concerns. 
I relayed this list of issues to Vacasa and they did compensate us with 10% back from the price of our stay. This is why I am (generously) awarding 3 stars..."

One of the chairs in the kitchen was broken when we arrived and wasn’t safe to sit on. The kitchen is advertised as well stocked, but they didn’t have basic things such as regular salt and pepper, measuring cups, or serving utensils. There’s no dishwasher, which is fine, but the dish soap provided had been watered down to be essentially useless and even that was almost empty. The fridge had spilled condiments in it that looked really old. A smoke alarm in the main bedroom wasn’t connected. There was also almost no room to park and this area wasn’t marked, so getting settled was stressful and the owners had to text us to explain things. The weirdest part of all of this is that the owners live maybe 100 yards from the place, so it’s wild that so many little things were just not taken care of and clearly hadn’t been in a long time. I also had a question prior to the stay and reached out to the property manager on VRBO and never heard anything back even after reaching out three times. 

My takeaway from this admittedly cute and well-decorated place is that it is much more concerned with aesthetics than being an actually functional place to stay. We made it work but dang. I’ve never had so much go wrong."

Unbelievable! When we arrived at the home, the gas was shut off to the exterior of the home and we could not get the pool, hot tub, grill or fire pit to work and we had paid $400 for the use of the fire pit and $800 for the pool! Management was insistent that we were not following the instructions for the mechanicals and did nothing. Since no one was coming to fix this issue we took time from our vacation to investigate and found that the exterior shut off valve was closed. We do not feel the pool and spa fees were properly disclosed to a renter before officially renting the home. The ice maker did not work and when reported the manager he turned it on and water froze all over the interior of the freezer but never made ice. His ""fix"" was just o turn it back off. The garbage cans on the home's exterior were full and we needed to notify the management so we were not charged for excessive garbage!

Sharon Wright, of issues with the condo and here are only some: second king bed was actually 4 twin mattress placed on king frame and they wouldn't stay together, we was told this was not the way it should be and they ordered a new mattress but that did not show up until exactly 1 week after our arrival. The tv in that same bedroom did not work and they got a new one & brought it after a week . The Hurricaine shutter over master bedroom screen patio was hanging halfway down and was broken and was never repaired for the 26 nights we were there.

It would seem that she is very busy lady with a lot of responsibilities, and not much time to dedicate to this vacation rental, or the needs of it's tenants. Eighteen friends and I have a yearly retreat, and our former lodging, a home in Heber was sold. This place seemed perfect for us, and it even had a hot tub, and beds for 21. Only we found out when we got there that there were only beds for 17, and the hot tub was broken. And things went downhill from there. The kitchen electrical circuit kept flipping off, and we learned that to use the microwave, we had to unplug everything else in the kitchen, including the stove. Also, a bedroom and the only bathroom in the basement had zero working outlets. When I texted Corinn about the electrical issues, she said no one had ever had issues like that before, so it followed that we could not be having those issues. When we checked the reviews, we saw that others had complained about the electrical issues. She did own that the hot tub was awaiting a part, and apologized. We all showed up with bathing suits-- such a disappointment! Then around 9 pm, a city water main broke, leaving us with no running water, no flushing toilets, until about 2:00 the next afternoon. So we spent several hours gathering snow in large bowls and melting it, oh so tediously, on the stove, a process that resumed again for several hours in the morning.
I reached out to Corinn the night of the water crisis and she said she would bring us drinking water the next morning, only she didn't. We kept melting snow and purchased drinking water and water to wash the dishes by hand. In addition, many commonly needed items were completely lacking -- kitchen basics like dish towels and extra paper towels, sharp knives, etc. The only thing to wash the dishes with were a couple of old, worn, mildewy sponges. At least 2 upstairs smoke detectors were broken, disconnected, and stashed in dressers. The basement bedroom with no working outlets also had no nightstands or bedside lighting or rugs on the cold floor. The television remote control had dead batteries, and no extras anywhere. The basement bathroom shower and curtain were dirty, and the whole house needed a deep clean. Many issues, little concern, and not following through on offer of recompense.

Linens were not fully restocked for our arrival and we caught and removed several roaches during our stay. There are about 15 roach boxes set out all over the place so it must be something they are working to resolve. Hopefully?

Typically if I am not satisfied with an experience, I just don’t leave a review. I am making an exception in this case because this host scammed me out of $185 (which I am currently disputing).

The beach and setting are nice. The building is old and dilapidated. Unpleasant odors in the unit and around the building. Door locks/scanner for fitness room were broken. Smoke or air detector in unit was constantly beeping for no apparent reason. There is construction in process, so it’s loud, and reserved parking spot is regularly used by others. Regular work truck traffic also blocks entry and parking. Shower has very weak water pressure and takes a long time to heat up. Pool is tiny. No hot tub.

I would have ignored all of this however, if the host hadn’t stuck me with a completely BOGUS “cushion damage/laundering” fee of $185 after my stay. I made multiple attempts to communicate with him regarding the erroneous charge, to try and get some clarity on the matter, but was completely ignored. There is absolutely no way we caused any damage to his cushions! We barely used them and everything looked just the way we found it when we left. The host lives on the mainland. I know this because I mailed his parking pass back to him. So, he is either dishonest OR he got bad info from his property manager. The fact that he wouldn’t communicate regarding the matter is unacceptable to me. 

I definitely won’t stay here again and would tell others to AVOID THIS HOST!"

But there is a decent lack of attention to detail and management oversight. 

I'm a property manager of vacation rentals so I'm the first to say I'm pickier than most guests. It is nicely decorated but not functional. Managers/owners should stay in their rentals as a test run and see it from the guests perspective.

Pretty cobblestone entrances are for home owners and designers, not vacation rentals. No one wants to drag several heavy bags of luggage over that. Especially with your elderly parent, uneven surfaces are a hazard. It was in the 40s that week, the house was freezing upon arrival and we accidentally hit the security/fire alarm trying to turn on the heat and that went off for 10 minutes. I wrote the manager who didn't seem to know there was an alarm or how to turn it off. No notes anywhere on how to operate things. The Hot and Cold valve is backwards in the shower; try waiting for that to heat up while stand there freezing cold and naked. The master bed frame broke making my sister in law to sleep on the couch freezing because no one could figure out the heater mechanism on the wall. Way too difficult to operate. And calling it a 4 bedroom is a stretch, its a 3 bedroom with a game room. 

We asked for help but didn't get it on the items of most concern alarm/bedframe/heater. Nice house, mediocre management. Sorry! There's actually more but Vrbo is cutting me off :)"

-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room

-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided

-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry
-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay. If they do fix the issues the house would be great. So please do take care and decide carefully when booking, if these are things you can overlook then go ahead. If I had known this was what I'd be walking into I wouldn't have made this booking. I hope this helps in your decision making process."

Positives of the house and our stay: great location to Deer Valley resort, large living areas, and beautiful views.

Unfortunately the negatives vastly outnumbered the positives. It started Wednesday when we realized warm water was a luxury and hard to come by. Barely any of the sinks and showers produced hot water and if you were lucky to get it, it went away almost immediately. 

Thursday we had a toilet that would not flush. In a house with 8 adults and 8 kids, you really rely on all toilets to work properly!

The hiccups continued into Friday night when we were abruptly awoken at midnight by blaring music from the living room wall speakers. We thought the house was possessed! None of us had connected to the sonos speaker system so we have no idea how it started playing out of nowhere! 

The nighttime disasters culminated the next night/morning. At 340am on Sunday the fire alarm in the master bedroom began to ring. We confirmed There was no fire, no emergency. It rang for 5 mins and stopped. Then restarted and stopped. The ringing continued every few mins for two hours!!! It could be heard throughout the home and everyone’s sleep was ruined. We called the emergency after hours phone number for assistance to no avail. No call back, no response. This is unacceptable! 

We had a terrible experience at this house and with Opulent Vacations and will not be returning.

We were not asking for the world, just the basics."

While the access to the building was easy, upon entering our unit #304 - we were overwhelmed with the smell of gas that hit us when we entered.

Not knowing how long that had been on - we quickly contacted you, were ready to contact the fire department, turned off the stove - and had to open all the windows and doors for a long while until the smell dissipated, then flee outside as we felt very unsafe.
 
Not a very warm welcome to Sonder property. 

Also, the unit was not what we expected in a scene of care and cleanliness. A few things: 

Bathtub in the first bath had a huge drain issue, and did not drain, leaving me to stand in gross water - then the next day the shower was so slippery from the residual soap - that it was super dangerous. 

The dishes in the cabinet were dirty - literally feel like a guest may have loaded the dishwasher - not run it, then housekeeping thought it was clean and put it away. So disgusting. 

The sheets in the guest bathroom appeared to have dried blood stains on them. 

NOTE: I reached out directly to the property managment company, Sonder directly to address this before sharing this review. The first attempt went completely ingnored, and the second attempts months later was met with a sorry, we will do better next time. Sorry, for me - there will certainly not be a next time."

We had no issue lighting the fire, the wood was there and they provided fire starter with matches. However, upon lighting fire we found the seal around the glass on the door was letting smoke in house with door shut. We proceeded to put the fire out and used the space heater and wall unit in bedroom. The wall unit makes the bedroom feel like a sauna but does not heat the rest of the house at all. We contacted host, and left the very next morning (we would have left that night, however, it was too late and no transportation was available) , the musty (potentially mouldy) smell was awful and made it difficult to breath through the night.

The pool is not heated, no big deal). Following these incidents we contacted the host, who required that we pay for the first night stay and a cleaning fee, however, they refunded the rest of the nights that we had already paid for.

The location of this unit is excellent. It’s super close to the slopes and we had a good view from the balcony to see our kids going down the slope. It was right next to the laundry room too, which was really convenient. There was a good selection of cookware and dishes in the unit, as well as a blender and a crockpot. The weren’t very many spoons/forks but we brought our own plasticware and disposable cups/plates/bowls so we were set. The listing indicated there was a Keurig, but there was not - there was a Mr. Coffee brewer so the k-cups we brought with us were useless. 

I’ve never stayed at any of the other condos in this complex so I cannot say how this one compares to the others, I can only share my experience/observations. 

Between beds, bunks and a pullout sofa, it slept eight. There was only enough seating for four people unless you used the barstools. The beds weren’t terrible, but they weren’t great either. Probably depends on what you’re used to. I’m told the bunks slept terrible. 

First thing we noticed when we arrived was the smoke alarm just inside the entry was hanging by wires and was covered with a plastic bag. Having no idea what was going on, we left it as it was. In addition to that, the toilet in main bath was shimmed on one side and didn’t appear to be properly attached to the floor, as it sometimes lifted off floor if you moved a certain way while using it. There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again."

Twice for smoke alarm issues one for a fan issue in MB. When the 2nd smoke alarm went off I was told by the mgmt. co. that they couldn't get someone there till the next morning. Listened to smoke alarm going off for 17 hours! I was very close to calling the fire department out of concern for my safety. This was a dangerous situation! How would I know if there was an actual fire without having a properly working smoke alarm!!! I was also told by the management co. that I should get up there and unplug the smoke detector myself!!!!! The outdoor furniture very rusty, patio was filthy, paint cans in b/r closet, horrible linens/bed pillows (only one set of sheets for MB), horrible pitted pans for cooking, tupperware needs to be replaced, sofa needs to be replaced-was shedding feathers/sunk almost to floor when you sat on it, dining room table very very shaky-afraid to sit there to eat, no parking passes for guests (even though I was allowed two spots). I took pictures of everything that I mentioned and will gladly forward them to you if you want them. Also my opinion of Florida Vacay Rentals is that they are a very poor management co. I've always used VRBO for ALL of my travel needs and never have I ever experienced anything like this. As a matter of fact I am a preferred guest with other owners. For what I paid for this condo and the experience that I had it is a travesty.

How can someone know that the gate is blocked on their first arrival if you stick that note inside the property??? The front gate area was stinking a lot. The fire alarm started making noise suddenly early morning around 4:30 am when everyone were sleeping and then automatically turned off in 4-8 minutes and ruined everyone’s sleep. There was no smoke there and it was malfunctioning. This happened several times actually. The only thing we all like was the area nearby.

The house comes equipped with everything you'd need for a great stay. Beds and couches were comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped and the place has games, a pool table, TVs, etc. 

We had two significant issues during our visit. The first relates to the temperature of the house, which we were told is at 55 degrees when not in use (in theory, we're all for this for energy conservation purposes). But it was colder than that when we arrived. Guests are supposed to use two built-in wall units to heat the house and aren't supposed to use the in-room radiators. This was really impractical. WITH the radiators and two space heaters, it took about 24 hours for the house to get up to a comfortable temperature (temps outside were between 20-35 degrees at first). One in-room bedroom radiator wasn't working, so that bedroom was out of commission for us. 

The second issue was with the upstairs fireplace. After checking to see that the damper was open and creating a good draft through the flue, our fire lit well but spewed an unusual amount of smoke into the house - so much so that we had to extinguish it. My guess is the chimney hadn't been cleaned properly. 

Raj was extremely responsive and helpful throughout. He seemed genuinely surprised about the heat and fire issues and tried asking around to see if anything could be done. Upon seeing that the temps were to drop to below zero on our third night, he had an extra space heater shipped to us. And upon being unable to sort out the fireplace issues, he volunteered to refund us for one out of our four nights. This was greatly appreciated, and he seems committed to making his guests' experiences positive. Five-star service, support, and communication. 

I will note a couple of other small issue that arose. One is the hot tub, which was inviting and warm but not quite 'hot' (though I will mention the weather was very cold outside). The other was that though there is a travel crib available, sheets for it were not. Not something I care about a lot, but others might.

Given Raj's sincere efforts to help and improve this experience, I expect future guests enjoy staying here even more than we did. But given how many options there are in the Poconos and how expensive they all are, we'd probably choose somewhere else next time."
