From this spot, we took in St. Augestine, NASA, New Smyrna, Ponce De Leon Lighthouse and beach, the State Parks north of Ormond, etc, etc. Also close enough to do theme parks if that's your jam. The condo unit was clean, well-maintained, and well-appointed. 

Downside was that after the hurricane, almost every Daytona Beach condo had damage to their pool decks and pools. So there was no pool at the condo, and the beach was fenced off the entire time we were there. You had to sneak around fences and gates to access the beach. High tide also made most of the beach unaccessable for several hours. During the day, there was a lot of construction on the beach. It is what it is, but I had no idea the damage was so extensive that far North. This is more an FYI for others who may ve considering this spot for vacation."

The outside of the property needs a bit of work (and not just because of hurricane damage) but inside, this particular unit seems to have been recently updated, is very clean, and offers a stunning ocean view. Entry access was clearly communicated and parking was no problem. LOVED the plush bath towels. We brought our own beach towels but unfortunately, never used them as we happened to be there during very chilly (and windy) weather! I found the king mattress to be comfortable but noisy…anytime my husband moved, it woke me up and my daughter said she could hear it from where she was on the sleeper sofa pullout (which she said was very comfortable). I’m not sure if that king mattress is new and just needs to be broken in or what. Overall, we really enjoyed this place and recommend it for anyone looking for a clean, relaxing place to stay. Also, the owners left a nice touch - when we arrived, there were snack bags and soap/bath/shampoo items on the large kitchen island counter! Thank you!"

A few disappointments included:
1) a fair amount of un-repaired and non-disclosed hurricane damage
2) incredibly uncomfortable beds & pillows
3) basic (standard) items were not included (ex. hand soap, toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags, dish soap, hangers)
4) not enough dinnerware for the number of people the listing said the house could sleep and only the 2-cup coffee maker worked
5) ants in both bathrooms and the kitchen
6) items advertised for kid-use were broken (ex. bike tires wouldn't hold air)
7) cupboards and closet doors were falling off hinges
8) canal dock lights did not work
9) pool remote did not work, therefore we could not heat it (to be fair, we did not call to ask this be fixed)

That’s not to say there weren’t pros:
1) beautiful sunsets on the canal
2) walking distance to many places
3) quiet neighborhood
4) there were 2 king beds and our kids LOVED having a double bunk bed room
5) neighborhood duck came to visit daily
6) beach buckets and shovels were available
7) early check-in approval
8) fast booking confirmation
9) friendly & helpful rep answered the phone when we arrived

Word of warning, beware of all the charges on top of rental and cleaning – combined these accounted for nearly 40% of our bill!

While the house met our needs as a place to sleep and eat occasional meals, it’s not a property we could recommend without a fair amount of TLC."
