When we thought it couldn't get better, we found this amazing place! The house is impeccably clean, so cozy and beautiful light throughout the days. The kids roamed freely and safely amongst the house and grounds and even our fur baby loved laying by the fire. Everyone has a spot with ample room to vacation as they wanted and all the right spaces to come together, as well. Our son is low verbal/AS and the security system gave a huge added peace of mind with notifications when doors and windows were opened and which ones. Added bonus, it is hard to find places with ample hot water and heat distribution - you won't be disappointed when the temps dip at night! As we pulled away, the kids asked when we are coming back - we can't wait! Ashley was a great communicator and I definitely encourage if youre looking to hit the book button!"

The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around, the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs earlier if it was allowed. They said yes, one hour no problem and 2 hours yes for $50 each of those hours. Since it actually came to about $5,300.00 for the 3 nights (2 days) another 100 bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on the check out .procedure."

This house was great. It’s in a beautiful location, under 8 minutes to town and it’s nice, quiet, and private. We had 2 families with kids that were able to all sleep comfortably in the house and then we were able to entertain some of our other relatives for dinner one night too. There’s plenty of space and it’s open and spread out so the kids could play in their own space as well. Everything was clean and put together. The hot tub was a nice bonus and the adult went in at night and enjoyed the stars and the kids went in during the day to play. Heather, the owner, was great and replied promptly. I needed a pack and play for my littlest and she was able to make sure one was there so I didn’t have to pack mine. We did have little ones (ages 7,5 and under 2) and I would watch them closely on the stairs because the railing seemed very low to me, and there’s a window seat that has a window down to the living room below, so those are just areas that someone with little kids should be aware of!

The beach is a short walk away and also very pleasant. Mosquitoes are a problem and some of the mosquito protection on the windows is broken. Citronella candles, deet and mosquito-killing spray are a must. Transport is also difficult. The local golf buggy rental centre did not have golf buggies available and the car parking space at the villa was so tight, it was almost impossible to park a car in. This leaves you walking to the supermarket in the heat or trying to get a taxi. Would suggest supermarket runs first thing in the morning or after sunset. We had some success using a wheeled suitcase to carry heavy groceries. You do need to buy bottled water for drinking, so you need to solve the shopping issue somehow. We did really enjoy our stay despite the issues, but will probably not return."

What we disliked: the unit we stayed in was not the one listed. I even asked the property manager about this prior to our stay because I noted they own multiple units in the building and previous reviewers called attention to this. They assured me it was going to be the one listed and it was not. We were happy with our unit, regardless. One of the key FOBs was very finicky (low battery perhaps?) and we were stuck in the parking garage upon check out for 20 minutes until another vehicle come through and let us out with their FOB. The owner was responsive in a timely manner but seemed put out by this requiring their attention and somewhat dismissive at the suggestion the FOB needed attention. If you have a small child, please be aware that the windows in the bedroom do not have safety locks. The unit was on the 5th floor and have awning windows with a small opening large enough for a small child to fit though."

We were able to check in early too, which was great.
The bad: The location is probably pretty dicey if you are a suburbanite but if you live in the city it’s not too bad. There is a food bank and planned parenthood on the corner, some closed stores, the house next door is boarded but I think they are working on it.
The weird: there were no drinking glasses in the house, there were some margarita glasses and coffee cups but nothing for just water. I think there are 7 forks for a house that can hold up to 14 people. The beds all had a fitted sheet and duvet with cover but no top sheet. 
The ugly: when we first got there, Aiste told us that the property manager was out of town for the first two days and the house would likely be cold. We understood and imagined it would be like, maybe 50 degrees at worst, because no one would want their pipes to freeze, etc. It was 32 degrees no joke, we had were shivering and had to leave for a while until it was reasonable to be in the house. Then, when my brother and his pregnant wife arrived, we realized that the downstairs bedroom windows were open and were broken, and incapable of closing. It was -2 degrees that night and the property manager was not available. There were no tools in the house, so we had to go to the hardware store to buy tape and plastic to try to keep my 7 months pregnant sister in law from freezing. Worst was that Aiste knew the windows were broken and knew we were coming (we paid in full 5 months ago), and knew it was winter, but did not have the basement windows fixed in a dangerous neighborhood where there was gun violence so near our house that the police asked us which direction the gun shots came from! And when it was -2 degrees outside. And then, unbelievably, asked us if we could fix it! I have the texts.

A really well appointed, clean townhouse that has an odd smell I could not figure out (mix of musty, moldy, urine, dampness, bad carpet). I notified the property manager Joanne about the smell expecting a solution (you know, cleaning or fragrances) and it's really hard to believe but Joanne's solution was for me to leave! If it sounds crazy, it is. Now you might think I did something wrong or I was rude, or demanding, I didn't. I have the entire transcript, happy to send along if you can find me via email. I asked her for a change of sheets as well, but she only had one set (for the week with no washer) and I informed her the toilets she had serviced still weren't working correctly. That was just too much. I think this is a sufficient property as long as you don't need anything of the property manager/don't mind off smells. This the wildest stay I've ever had. You know how it is with narcissism, criticism isn't handled very well. Long story short, I was evicted after asking about the smell. Also, be warned, next door is a burned out townhouse with broken windows and full of trash from a fire that killed the tenant. A sketchy view from the king bedroom window.

You might be better off staying somewhere on Washington St or in Harpers Ferry. 

Maybe the owners will get a new property manager because this one is losing them money."

This property was advertised as a two bedroom. It is NOT. It is a studio apartment with a bed and a futon in the kitchen. 
Upon arrival my family and I came to a parking area and this stay is located in the back building behind a car park, a bit sketchy and uneasy feeling. Upon entry, the hallway leading to the apartment was wide open, and mailboxes were broken and smashed in. We get to our door and the lock box barely worked. Entering, everything looked ok, further settling in and checking out the space, the window was left open, dust everywhere, broken cabinets, entry way door frame broken scratched as though someone had attempted breaking in. Cooking glass countertop chipped and broken. Food residue on plates. Pillow cases with black stains and dirt marks. We pulled the bed sheets back and saw more black/dirt marks, fresh spots of blood and pubic hair. 
The bathroom photographed in these photos is not the layout of the actual bathroom we had. 
The faucet for said bathroom was also broken. Upon booking in Oct when I wrote to the host, he never got back to me. Upon arrival, it took VRBO and myself several attempts to reach the owner and they did not respond to any of my messages until after the remainder of payment was made. 
After contacting VRBO, and by THEIR suggestion to contact the owner/manager of said property to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. 
To may dismay their attempt to rectify the situation by giving them a day to ""change the sheets""...... the one with blood and pubic hair on them....

We decided not to stay because of the unsanitary practices of listing and misrepresentation of the listing, and because as a guest I believe that their resolution was unsatisfactory. 
We were advised by VRBO that we could not cancel since we arrived at the location and it was up to the owner to decide whether or not they wanted to refund our money.... you can see where this is going. Even though I wanted to cancel the reservation the DAY OF arrival. 
6-8 phone calls/chats later and ""we're sorry you've experienced this"" with VRBO for the promise of sending my inquiry to management... nothing, no response, no follow up and 8 case file numbers later. 
Not only do I suggest NOT to book with City Sparrow Apartments, I would reconsider booking with Vrbo."

The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs hotel earlier if it was allowed. They said one hour early- no problem and 2 hours yes for an hourly fee.. Since it actually came to over five racks for the 3 nights (2 days) another few bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on how to check out. Argumentative"

Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken
-Most of the house windows were dirty also covered in spider webs
-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided 
-All the beds were very very hard, also terrible pillows, and beds were not made properly
-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry
-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay. If they do fix the issues the house would be great. So please do take care and decide carefully when booking, if these are things you can overlook then go ahead. If I had known this was what I'd be walking into I wouldn't have made this booking. I hope this helps in your decision making process."

Cons: House needs EXTREME updating. I have rented MANY houses and this is by far the worst one and first bad review I have ever left. The upstairs “suite” has a bathroom that looks like it’s from the 70’s, with a terrible size shower and water pressure. It was absolutely FREEZING in the bathroom as well. Advertised as a queen size bed but very I comfortable for my husband and I to both sleep in felt more and looked more like a double. Staying on walls in bathrooms and on doors. Beware if you have small children there’s a window like shutter in the bedroom that you can easily be a hazard as the ledge for it is low. The house I also advertised in the description as a 3 bedroom meanwhile on of the bedrooms has a sofa with a pullout. Old blinds that are yellow in color. Old tile flooring in the 2 bedrooms on the main floor. Cracks on the walls. The basement is completely unfinished with old worn leather couch and old cushion couches. Concrete floor, Would not want to spend anytime hanging out down there in that kind of condition. Overall this house really needs to be updated and furnishing replenished before being rented out. My husband and I really did not sleep well because of the lack of space and comfortability for us to sleep."

First, we did not receive the code for entry of the house. I had to call the management company (AMI) when we arrived. Not a great start. Upon entry, we discovered the water was turned off. Although I understand this is probably not a recurring issue with this house, this was unacceptable. The water was off for 24 hours before it was finally restored. AMI handled this issue as quickly as they could.

When we arrived, the handle to the kitchen sink was completely broken off. I fixed it myself. The elevator was not working, so we had to haul every bin and bag we had up the stairs (and you’re talking, like, 20 foot levels).

The pool was “working” but the lights as well as the waterfall jets were not. This needs to be fixed as the lights at night would be nice and probably a bit safer. The listing says the pool is serviced twice a week: not true. Not a single person came to service or clean the pool the entire time we were there and we had to contact the management company three times to get someone to come out and finally look at it. A tech came who had no clue how to fix it BUT they did leave the hose in the pool, blasting water for over four hours before we noticed it was overflowing and finally realizing the hose was running. 

NONE of the TVs worked when we got there. AMI said someone would come out. I figured out what was wrong myself before the tech came many days later. 

VERY unhappy about the $120+tax “damage fee” they charge. Apparently this is non-refundable. If AMI/VRBO charges every guest a damage fee before setting foot on the property, EVERYTHING should be in working order. What am I paying this for, exactly? Stay here at your own risk. There is a guestbook in the living room where everyone signs and tells a little about their stay. We are not the first to have issues here… Although the location of the property is unbeatable and many other aspects of this property are nice, this property has a long history of broken things. (This includes windows that were also still broken when we stayed there) We are not the exception when it comes to these issues.

The good:

The backyard pool area is nice and secluded with excellent landscaping. The rooftop deck has the best views of both the harbor and the ocean. The sunsets are great. All the patios are great. Having beach cruiser bikes in the garage was nice as well.

Good luck!"

Finally, 2 hours and 45 minutes after our initial attempt we got into the building.

In addition to the issues getting into the building we also were not able to find the parking pass in the unit that was required to park in the garage (normally this is placed in plain sight with other key items). We called the 1-800 number and were told to look on the kitchen counter (obvious) and inside the ski
locker (not sure why it would be there but it wasn’t). It was 10pm when we called and they said there was nothing they could do about it at that time but they would come ASAP. They never followed up."

The house is pretty much brand new with all new modern appliances and everything you need to relax and enjoy your vacation. The beds and pillows are comfortable, we all slept great. Much needed after some long fun ski days at the pass. 

No cell service so make sure you screenshot your welcome message from Lane that has the door entry code. Wifi is great and we had about 15 devices connected without issue. You can make calls etc. from the Wi-Fi.

One window shade was broken and we couldn’t use the fireplace as it was being worked on. This was communicated to us prior to arrival so we knew what to expect. 

Great communication from the owner as well! 

All in all a wonderful experience and we will be returning again soon!"

In the year since I was last here, the property (unfortunately) has clearly not been maintained. 

- The home has a lot of wear and tear, and has a dingy feel to it. Lots of dings in the walls and doors, worn/stained carpet, loose bannisters, broken window shades, etc. I question if the sheets in my bed were changed, based on all the hair when I pulled back the covers the first night.
- The plumbing was an issue during our stay, with a leaky pipe in one bathroom, and a broken handle in the other. To be fair, the local property manager Keith was on it in a hurry.
- The hot tub was a nice add, but the water was terribly filmy. It takes more than a chlorine floaty to keep those things clean.
- The kitchen still does not have enough utensils for cooking, and only glassware to drink out of- not good if you have kids! 
- The check-in/out process is very easy, as Vacasa provides a lot of information.
- As stated above, the local property management is very responsive. This was the case last year as well, which was a pleasant surprise this time around.
- Lastly, this would be a really nice place to stay with just a little more TLC. The home has all the potential to be a solid vacation rental- it has great amenities, its in a decent location, and its fairly close to stores, restaurants, and the ski resort."

The house was unlivable. first was a broken window. the rooms had beds lines up in every room. Walls looked like people or things had been thrown up against them. locks on the doors outside of the room (to lock people in) basement door only had a lock on the outside again to lock someone in the basement. It was described to me as a human trafficking house or a prostitution house for the way it was setup. there is camera and monitors in every room.

It was initially hard to find since the there were no distinguishing signs for the turn off to the location. After calling the caretaker, she was able to talk us through the directions to the property. The place was comfortable, but could use a bit of maintenance. It wouldn’t take much to make this place a 9 out of 10. As it stands it’s probably a 6/7 out of 10. Fresh paint to cover water stain in the ceiling, replace broken bathroom exhaust fan cover, replace torn porch window screen. All of those cosmetic issues give the place a shabby look. On the positive side, the place has all you need for a short stay. Nice kitchen with full size refrigerator and utensils for cooking. Adequate seating in the living room. Tv with cable service and fast wifi. Bed were comfortable. The 1 bathroom was adequate in size, just a bit dated/worn down, but clean. It’s a short drive to Key West so it serves at a nice jumping off point. Did not get to use any of the other amenities such as the pool since we were there in January. Good value for the price and condition of the property. Would stay there again. Beware of hidden fees. His was my first Vrbo rental so that maybe typical for the service."

It’s super bright through all windows as the lights out back are always on. There’s zero real curtains with privacy. The bunk room was freezing cold. The dishes weren’t clean in the cupboard. The front room was also very cold due to the windows letting air in. The surrounding area is never quiet. There was not a colander or much to cook with. Great amount of cups though.
