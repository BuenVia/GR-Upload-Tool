Cleaners arrived after us and was there an hour after the updated check in time.
Getting the correct address was challenging and when we did get the address it was 49 minutes away from the pin drop on this app. Luckily there was regular local buses. But it added extra cost and time. We picked this place based on its location so was disappointed. There is very little beach most of the time none at all due to the sea, the steps leading down to the water is unsafe as its cracked on both sides so you are unable to go into the water from this access point.
The whole place smells of damp we had to keep the aircon on to stop the bedrooms from smelling. Leaving cupboard doors open. 
The cleaners put damp smelling sheets on the beds and we were left with dirty towels.
The kitchen cupboards also smell and apart from the microwave/coffee maker/cooker all other appliances listed are there but all have stickers on them stating they do not work.
Kitchen equipment is old and mix match. No scissors etc.
My friend got an electric shock from the smallest bedroom. The bigger room the plugs would spark now and again same for the plug by the kitchen bar.
One bathroom completely unusable (toilet, shower and sink) the main bedroom shower would not drain properly.
Pool was nice the block is rented out by mostly retired Canadians. Burger boys across the road... amazing food oxxo close by so not all bad!"

In particular we were excited to use enjoy the sauna and spa bath as a way to get some winter relaxation. At first glance the property was OK - decently clean, but without any basic amenities like toiler paper, hand towels, linens, or any thing at all supplied. The kitchen supplies where all damage garbage. Worst of all, the sauna and tub, though they looked beautiful, where not in good working order. Both only worked for the first 12 hours of our stay, before an electrical short caused them to both stop working. Even before then, the sauna was of terrible quality with absolutely no insulation, leaking cold air so bad you could feel your feet getting cold even with the sauna at the maximum heat. The pool also did not get hot at all and was restricted to a maximum of 39.5c, luke warm at best. Even still, we could have enjoyed them, but after the short, the property manager sent out a repairmen who claimed we were lucky to not have been electrocuted by the short and that we would not be able to use the facilities for the rest of our 3 night stay. We were so disappointed we decided to just pack up and leave early, as this poorly lit and managed property, which terribly dim, cold, and boring, was not worth staying in without these amenities. Anyone booking this place should know it is being managed by a Danish corporation without any personal feeling whatsoever and is nothing more than a shoddy, dangerous tourist trap looking to take your money. We would never stay at this property again and will avoid ANY property run by novasol."

 Positive point: it has three complete bathrooms with shower.
 There's a Walmart next door, you can walk there, it's about a 10 minute walk.

We had a problem with the internet, there was no Wi-Fi for 9 days, I had to spend money on new SIM cards for the family's cell phones. The problem was with Spectrum's equipment, Shelly provided the repair.
The refrigerator leaks water internally and ends up wetting food, I had to put a container for the water inside the refrigerator.
