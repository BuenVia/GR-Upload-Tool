There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

It is freshly painted, has a nice driveway and an attractive garden. Inside is a different story to the extent we have lodged an official complaint with VRBO.
We booked the villa a year in advance of our stay of 3 weeks in January 2023 on the basis of - to quote from the villa’s site - “completely renovated (end of works April 2019) and “a completely new kitchen and very well equipped.” These statements are totally untrue.
The kitchen is the same kitchen that was there in January 2014, some 9 years ago! Same cupboards, fridge, well used and grubby utensils and utensils’ box, rusty dangerous kettle (the steam pours out of the on/off switch where your hand goes.) and a filthy waste bin area. Random grubby and useless items were in the kitchen drawers. The gas hob had one non functioning and alarming ring which we had to avoid.
We have supplied VRBO with photographic evidence of all these comments.
The site quotes “sheets, linen and towels are hotel quality”. This was not the case - bed linen was thin and of poor quality and we were expected to have the same sheets throughout our 3 week stay as no clean ones were provided until we insisted the cleaner came and unlocked the cupboard the sheets were locked in.
No information/instruction folder was to be found on arrival which is essential when trying to settle in to a new home."

The third bed listed in the description of the property a sofa sleeper/futon bed which I planned for my adult children to take turns sleeping on. We arrived at the property at 1AM on Sunday morning. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the couch and chair in the living room were neither sleeper sofas nor futons and were not big enough for a 10 year old child to sleep on much less a full grown adult! I found a phone number for the host and texted him asking if we had been given the wrong condo as I was very specific with him prior to our trip that we needed a third bed. He never once said that the 3rd bed was an air mattress that needed to be blown up after we arrived, but this is what he texted me in the wee hours of the morning after we arrived! I could not even find the mattress until the next morning as the closet where it was stored was in a bedroom where my son had already gone to bed. I found the mattress the next morning and when I blew it up the air rushed out through a giant hole in the seam! I called the host and he insisted that it was standard that the 3rd bed was an air bed...never disclosed on VRBO, much less expected when you are booking a vacation property as opposed to an Air B and B. Later that day he had Instacart drop off a new bed. The new bed needed batteries in order to use the pump provided with the bed, however the batteries were not included...stated right on the front of the box..batteries not included! Meanwhile, I filed a complaint with VRBO about the bait and switch in the property description. They finally agreed to rebook us in a different property, but only if the host cancelled our current booking! I went back and forth via text with the host insisting he cancel our booking and he refuseed. I requested he at least refund the cleaning and service fees and he still refused. He then started referring to the fourth person in our party as an ""extra guest"". I booked and paid for 4 adults and specifically requested accommodation with 3 beds. I was never once told the third bed would be an old air mattress with a giant hole in it! The carpet throughout the unit is filthy dirty, the ceiling fans were filthy dirty , the stove and microwave were either really dirty of damaged, there was a giant smear of greas on the cabinet over the microwave. There were holes in walls and dents in doors"

Cons - Arrived Saturday night, had great difficulty finding a driving route to the property, as many roads in the area were closed off (which is a nightly occurrence). It would’ve been nice to have known this beforehand, and given driving instructions to bypass the numerous road closures. Very noisy locale, given the many bars and in the area - music was blaring till 2 AM every night. The room suite itself was OK, but dated. Barbeque was rusted and ancient. Glass range cooktop was significantly damaged with very large cracks in the surface (a small, portable electric burner was provided). The built-in microwave was also not working (a small, portable microwave was also provided). As is common with other resorts and condominium properties, finding a poolside lounge chair can be daunting if you’re not up early and reserving one for yourself (even though you are instructed not to reserve a chair and leave it for an hour or more, nobody follows that rule…and on-site security doesn’t enforce it)."

And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues."

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here."

We enjoyed our 10 day stay. Fish Market across the street with fresh caught fish daily. Food truck court just down the street was fun. Other small eateries and coffee shops within walking distance. Grass area with beach chairs/lounges with the waves pounding the wall in front of you. The unit's location to beachfront is hard to beat.
However, here are some observations about the condo. 
The photographer did an amazing job of making the unit look twice the size it actually is. 
Balcony and living areas are comfortable and spacious compared to the rest of the unit.
Bathroom area with shower is small but adequate for two people, not more. 
Kitchen is very small but has a full size range and microwave. No oven, but we didn't go there to make Thanksgiving dinner! Small toaster oven is provided but would not fit even a small pizza. Cooking utensils were minimal. Not many drinking glasses, especially plastic ones for the beach.
Bedroom featured a king-size captain's bed that filled the room. If you are shorter than 6 feet tall or have trouble climbing and jumping you might have trouble getting into the bed. My wife is 5 feet tall and I had to pull her into bed each night. It is comfortable once you are in it, but hard to get into. Very little room to move around the bed. We had to move a couple of items out of the room to make it easier to get around the bed. Closet is adequate size with hangers and shelves, and the captain's bed has large drawers that pull out for storing items, but they are hard to access because of how close the bed is to the walls.
Laundry facilities were easy to use and located on all levels except the first level.
Getting to the small beach in front of the break wall was difficult due to damaged stairways on both ends of the property. The damage, likely from storms, is bad enough that the stairs are fenced off. Access to the beach is by climbing down the 4-5 foot wall made of lava rock, not something everyone will be able to do. A short walk north along the street takes you to a nice public access beach where you can spend the day or just walk back through the tidepools to the front of the Paki Maui property.
Pool area was nicely outfitted with gas grills. Spa was warm and comfortable. Pool is not heated so it was not comfortable to be in (we visited in January) unless you are from Minnesota, in which case you would probably love it!
Several maintenance items had been overlooked and we hope they are repaired for the next visitor (all reported to property manager). Bathroom sink drained painfully slow. Kitchen faucet was wobbly and not properly attached to the counter top. Microwave control buttons for lights/fan were loose and hard to operate. Towel rack inside shower had been previously broken and poorly repaired requiring us to continually put it back in place.
Again, overall we enjoyed ou stay at Paki Maui but found the attention to detail for a property priced at this level to be lacking. Next visit we would choose a different property. We hope this helps those considering this unit."

The house could use some TLC, but the picture windows, lake view, hot tub and multilevel deck more than compensated for the less-than-perfect interior.

We had high expectations based on the pictures of the house and our first stay. With the experience I have in the travel & tourism industry, I am used to reviewing properties. Unfortunately, Sandy Escape did not meet expectations. The following were the main issues:
 - The property was quite unclean with piles of dirt left in the downstairs bathroom. 
 - We advised there would be 10 adults staying but were only provided with 7 bath towels, even though information states bath towels are provided for all guests. 
 - Only 2 burners on the 6 burner stove work. 
 - The ice or cold water dispenser in the fridge did not work. 
 - The media/tv room on the first floor was very dirty with stains on the couch and the blinds unable to be used due to being damaged. 
 - All floors were very dirty. There is a broom but no dustpan and brush to be able to sweep up the sand/dirt.
 - Although hand soap containers were in both bathrooms and kitchen, they were empty and we needed to buy soap for them. 
 - No dishwashing liquid was provided to be able to wash dishes. 
 - They do provide dishwasher tablets for the 1 drawer dishwasher. 
 - Not enough plates or cutlery for 10 adults.

We were very disappointed with the state of the property and felt that it was a long way from being value for money. We would not be able to recommend this property. It is way overpriced for how it presents presently."

Be sure to bring toilet paper because there is a limited amount even though listing does not stipulate to bring more outside of 2 rolls per bathroom.

We cooked every meal but did not have any food storage options(Tupperware) for leftovers.

While this is a great location and very spacious, the king beds are very worn down and have big impressions in them which make it hard to get comfortable and sleep well.

When we arrived, there were past guest’s supplies left in the fridge, one tv had been damaged prior to our stay, lights out and flickering in fridge and microwave, and dishwasher did not really clean the dishes. There was a white film on all the dishes and they had to be washed prior to using.

Again, we had a wonderful time and it is a great location for a family ski trip, just a few considerations would have made it even better!"

+ Das Haus ist Alarm gesichert.

o Küche ist mit Allem nötigen für 6 Personen ausgestattet
o Es gibt (wie im meisten Ferienhäuser) keine Garderobe im Flur oder in der Diele. Man hat aber reichlich Platz für Sofa und Sessel.
o Die Klopapierhalter sind magnetisch und schwergängig aber funktionieren. Bitte vorsichtig öffnen, weil jemand schon die Dübel aus der Wand gerissen hat.
- Die Kühlschranktür wurde mit Anschlag-Rechts montiert statt Links. Der Kühlschrank erlaubt eine Montage mir dem Türanschlag links und so wäre es auch viel einfacher gewesen etwas aus dem Kühlschrank zu holen und auf dem Tisch zu stellen.
