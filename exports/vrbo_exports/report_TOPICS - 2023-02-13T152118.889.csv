63de487639757b125bcff274,8181316766,NOT SPECIFIED,33580003,1675511936341,04/02/2023 11:58:46 CST,19th century cottage a few steps from the beach,en_us,83,beautiful location,The beach down the slip is private,HR_REVIEWTEXT,"When we arrived Jan 20,2023 the house was extremely cold! It took 2 full days before it felt warm, the owner asks that the heat be turned off at night and once the house warmed up we were able to do that easily, the house would warm back up very quickly.

We did find that many items in the house are overdue for replacement. The bath towels were so thin, the coffee & cream containers were rusted inside, we only had 1 dish rag and dish towel, the fitted sheets elastic was basically gone.
If you go here with the understanding that you need to bring some basic things like bath towels, wash rag or sponge for the the bath and some essentials for the kitchen like extra dish rags, towels, coffee press, paper towels.

The area was wonderful, the only issue is a neighbor on the hill with a Great Dane that he brings down the hill to poop everyday and never cleans it up, it is EVERYWERE!!!

The Cliff walk is amazing, you can walk into town to grab a pint or bite after your cliff walk there and then walk back to the cottage. The beach down the slip is private and relaxing, we took a dip in the sea a couple mornings, so invigorating.

The owner Lina is wonderful and quick to respond to any messages, We would love to come back to this area in the future."
