We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done."

We were stuck w/ hours of no water in the bathrooms until night after a 4hr road trip to get here. The only irresponsible solve the host gave us was to walk for a full refund WTH! We had to sort this ourselves w/ Northstar security after hours, glad this wasn’t a gas leak. Such crappy service for that $$$. Stay away & look for some place / host that cares & is hospitable."

It will accommodate 6 however. There were some nice beach chairs and flotation devices supplied in the shed across the street by the canal which was handy. Easy check in and out. The grill connection to the propane bottle has a gas leak but otherwise everything worked very well. There is a nice patio on the ground floor which i understand well be becoming a swimming pool soon, but the best view is from the wrapm around deck upstairs. wished it had better tv channel selection, but if you can bring you access from your tv at home, you can use Hulu, netflix, sling, etc. Overall we had a great time and would recommend this host and the property."

I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak! 

The net is I would not stay here again."

Finding the dingy was not to hard. We got the motor fired up, loaded up the dingy & took the first load out to the boat. That took a little time to find but once you find it it was pretty easy. On our way back to shore the motor died, out of gas. Luckily it died at shore. We texted Isidora. She respond quickly & came out filled up the dingy with gas & we were on our way. Though this time the motor was not responding like it was when we first arrived. The main reason that we decided to stay on the boat was because she offered dingy & two kayaks that we could explore the mangroves with. But the motors not working correctly. Besides that the first night wasn't bad. The next day we get up & head into town to get some fishing gear & breakfast. That morning the motor was a pain to start. So I text her to try & get the motor fixed or to have the spare motor put on the dingy. She said her mechanic will be there around 12 or 1 to fix it. So we spend the morning buying fishing gear, having breakfast & exploring Key Largo. At 2, I reach out to her & she says that it should be good to go. We get back to the dingy it starts right up & we start taking off. To only have the motor die half way out to the boat. By this point we are stating to get annoyed with everything. So we limp it back to the boat. Once again I contact her & say that dingy is not working. She then says she will get her mechanic & will bring the other motor out & swap them. Perfect right, nope. By now its 2:45pm. She said she would just meet us at the boat with the mechanic to fix it. At 4pm she says that her mechanic is no where to be found so she needed us to limp the dingy back to shore, so we do. With no mechanic in sight we had to swap out the motor. Which normally we would not have a problem with that. But after today we are just over it. We get covered in gas/oil from the leaky motor. My buddy hurt his back from carrying the motor back to the car for her. So now it's our last day, we just spend the whole day messing around with the motor. Bought all of this fishing gear & its now 5pm & we just got back on the water. Also mosquitoes ate us ALIVE. She said that she would refund us for our troubles. We thought that was a very nice gesture. Since we left I have text her multiple times inquiring about the refund & no responses. She leaves my ""texts"" on read but thats it. Do not waste your time with this VRBO. You are better off picking a different host."

Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!"

We initially thought this poisoning happened at the hot springs we were at and we didn't say much to Ron. Then the carbon monoxide ""experts"" came and checked the house when it completely aired out. I talked with someone in the ambulance when they were giving the kids oxygen and they said this wasn't the first time the ""big house on the corner"" filled up with carbon monoxide. The next day we received our paper work and one of the kids got ""food poisoning"" which was very weird since everyone that was helping us said we had carbon monoxide poisoning. When we were leaving the house, I got a text from Ron about some missing remote and that I should keep a habit of putting it in place. I said to him ""I haven't even seen a remote downstairs and he shouldn't talk like that to me after what happened"" and his response was ""I will counter it with the food poisoning paperwork"" that he found in the trash. Today I received a huge fine for ripped couch, railing damage, remote control lost etc. for damage I never did! Ron has completely lost his mind."

Everyone enjoyed their rooms, the great showers/bathrooms and the wonderful kitchen area (I may be stealing some ideas from that awesome island for my kitchen rebuild soon)
There was a huge consensus about the desire to return to the house for future trips.

There was an issue with a smell in the downstairs kitchen/bunkbed area the first morning. I called the property manager a couple times and left messages about it before we figured out it was tied to hot water use. When my call was returned the evening of the next day I was informed that it was a normal occurrence when the property has been vacant for a bit of time related to water system drainage. By that time the smell had stopped occurring and our initial concerns that it was a small gas leak were alleviated."

We were given 2 choices as a replacement. We did not like the choices but took the Cabin on Hackberry instead of the other place because of stairs at the other place. We think we should have been given the opportunity to reschedule at our original choice at another date. We left a day early due to the weather and the location and the layout of the replacement property. We think you should give us a credit for use at the property we wanted at another time.
