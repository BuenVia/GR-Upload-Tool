We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

While it’s much appreciated that accommodation like the Raetihi bach is available at low cost, and a more basic standard is expected for the price, there were a few issues. The bach was quite dirty when we arrived. We’ve left it cleaner than when we arrived, but providing some cleaning products (cloths, toilet cleaner, gloves, etc) would help future people with this. More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous. In short, we think the bach needs a check and a good clean before the next people come in."

It was the perfect location in the city and easy to get to. Beds were very comfortable. Home was well stocked with supplies and necessities except for one oversight of not having kitchen trash bags. Communication with the property manager was great.

The home is very large so there were a few areas that was overlooked when it came to cleaning and maintenance. The previous guest left a used sanitary napkin in the master closet. The towels in one of the guest rooms were still a bit damp like they just were not left in the dryer long enough. Also the smoke alarm started beeping with low battery alerts the second day, and the heat lamp on the roof did not seem to work (or we just didn’t know how to work it w/o instructions) Other than that everything else was perfect and it was the perfect birthday retreat/staycation."

He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice.

Perfect for 2 adults. Any more would be a bit tight given the limited amount of closet space and how small the bedrooms are. My only major criticism is that for a 2 week stay it would have been nice to offer a full cleaning / laundry / sheet change at the end of one week....that would have happened in any case had I rented 2 x one week so not sure why it was not offered. 
The garage was just big enough for a standard SUV and that was a good thing as there are generally NOT enough ""visitor"" parking spots when you need them (at night). Having said that, the management company was very responsive when the smoke alarms went off in the middle of the night (annoying--a step ladder should be provided) and for other small questions.

Cleanliness of the condo was definitely not the best, stuff from previous ""renters"" were still in the rooms. Lost internet for most of the stay which sucked but not much you can do about that. Smoke alarm started to beep do to low battery in the middle of the night. Very minimum things in there. Normally there is trash bags, ziploc bags, foil, salt and pepper, sugar, coffee not at this place. It literally has bare minimum in there.

It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.

Excellent space for a family of 5. House was really clean and tidy, really well looked after (even if it looks a bit dated in parts in the photos - yes it is, but it’s fine and in really good condition). Beds, linen, pillows all fantastic, great condition and very comfortable. Pool table was fun and three TVs were great. Internet perfect. Smoke alarms went off once for no reason and another time just opening the oven. Not a big deal. Slight leak in kitchen skylight in heavy rain was a bit of pain but didn’t cause a significant problem. Would definitely stay here again. Best improvement to make would be a nice outdoor area to sit and relax outside, not particularly inviting and so we didn’t hang out the back at all. Again, not a big issue but would’ve made it that much better. Thanks for providing a nice place."

Dollar store TP and paper towels gotta go. I had to purchase my own. None of the remotes worked, had to buy batteries. Smoke detector was beeping, had to replace a 9V battery there. 

Bed was horrible, I barely slept. And the HVAC system was so loud that if I did fall asleep, it wouldn't last long. Remote work was uncomfortable because my only option was the kitchen table with non optimal chair. 

Listing said there was a fitness center. I never found it. There was a bike parked outside, I assumed it was for the property, but it had two flat tires and a rusted chain so that wasn't going to do any good.

The location was quiet and other than the upstairs neighbor having an occasional wrestling match with his dog (I'm guessing) the noise and traffic in the complex was acceptable.

For my next visit to Mesquite I will look elsewhere."

The beds were so comfortable; we slept so well! Location was great and easy to access. Plenty of space for sleeping , easily sleeps 10. Xbox was a hit with the kids. Hot tub was nice. 
Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out. Ping pong table net is hanging on by a thread, and one of the fooz ball players is broken. Lastly, the advertising was slightly misleading as we thought this was a house. It is a duplex, connected with one other building. Not a huge problem, but we prefer a detached home when it's advertised as a house.

During our first night were awaken by smoke detectors blaring throughout the house, and after inspecting we realized there was no threat or reason for the alarms to be going off. We were unable to disarm the alarms, and attempted several times to get in contact with Randy (for over an hour) with no response. We ended up needing to call 911 and have the fire department show up to disarm. Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub. You can definitely find a more comfortable stay elsewhere with better management. Save yourself the headache of booking here."

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :). We were so appreciative. 

Thank you Jay & his concierge, for offering this wonderful lake home. We can’t wait to come back. 

P. S. The wifi is great!"

Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!!

I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""? What a crock of BS if I've EVER heard!! You're better off finding a 4 star hotel & paying $250-$300 a night to be treated way better & NOT have to deal with a bunch of shady Mexicans trying to enter your room!!"

We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price."

We stay at many VRBO's and this property was one of our worst. The issues were all communicated to the management company upon checkout and to this day, almost a month later, we have not received any type of resolution. 
 
Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard. The communication was subpar both locally and from Evolve. Very disappointing!"

Two years in a row the heat was an issue. The manager/owner fixed it, but, it was something we had to deal with. One side of the stove is not working and the other side worked half the time. Hard to bake if the oven won't stay on and the kitchen is part of the reason we stay at this house. The kitchen needs a good cleaning. With a professional stove you deal with a lot of grease and the area around the stove and the vent area needs attention. We had to fix a few chairs that had loose legs when we got there and one of the chairs at the dining room table is broken. The grill on the back porch also needs a good cleaning. When grilling or smoking it ends up firing up because of all the old grease left on it and it has a few broken parts. The last thing is the wood burning fire place, the chimney probably needs a clean out. When starting a fire you end up with a lot of smoke in the house until the fire gets really hot."

Lots of open living area. Not well stcked with pots and pans. Broken handles and burnt pans. No crock pot and the mirco wave was unusable. Rusted and burnt inside. We kept it unplug due to the fire hazard. Also left main bedroom, the floor was sunken. Worried that the under floor had dry rot. Only cool water in the main bathroom for showers. If upgrades were made, it would be a great house and would rent it again."

It is a nice gated community that is pretty quiet (we had one problem neighbor who wanted to stand outside and talk loud under the master bedroom window until about midnight) with a great resort-style pool. The condo itself was clean, but tired. It really needs much TLC. The sofa was hard to sit on, the cushions just sink into the frame as it is a pull out. Also, the owner was very nice and responsive, but cannot say the same for her property management company. We had a problem with a smoke alarm going off randomly and she had to resort to calling the HOA President, Andy, who came over on a Friday night to change the batteries in all the alarms. Evergreen, the Property Mgmt Co was supposed to have come over the day before, but didn't return phone calls on Friday when the problem persisted. Again, you get what you pay for so this isn't a complaint, just so anyone in the future will know before you go!"
