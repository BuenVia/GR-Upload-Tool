Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat."

The first night, 1:29 am, to be exact, all power went out in the entire Bodega Bay area due to fallen trees and branches. The owner and manager gave us directions immediately about emergency supplies and we really appreciated the wall-outlet flashlights that lit up immediately when the power failed, We were able to light the gas stove with matches, so we had tea while we enjoyed the storm. The propane fireplace worked, as well, so we were warm and cozy. The next morning, Erika called to see how we were doing and asked the local rep to bring new flashlights and a butane lighter for the stove, The power was out for 22 hours, but we enjoyed every minute. The rest of the week was rainy, and Erika texted us each day to see how we were doing. Beds were comfy, the kitchen perfectly provisioned and the views both peaceful and spectacular, We shall return for retreats as often as possible,"

It’s so well decorated and READY for guests - you’ll see what I mean when you stay. Everything is labeled with directions and it truly seems like they thought of everything. 

Only issue we had was the power went out and with young kids we were nervous about it getting too cold and their milk/food spoiling. Apparently this is an issue in this area bc we heard the neighbors generator turn on immediately. Unfortunately, the generator for this house was being installed on the Monday after we left, so we didn’t have that luxury, but future renters will have backup. :) We “survived” the power outage just fine as it was restored within a couple hours. 

The kitchen is a bit smaller than it looks in photos. just a heads up that it could get a little tight in there, especially for bigger people. 

Also, the 3rd bedroom is really a loft in the upstairs office and there’s a metal spiral staircase going up. We thought this would be where my 5yo would sleep until we saw the spiral staircase. That made us nervous if he got scared or woke up in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was an air mattress with all the necessary linens that he could use instead. The loft might be ideal for kids, but probably better for older kids (middle school to college-aged, IMO). The ceiling is slanted and I don’t know if you could stand straight up there to be honest. 

All in all, it was a great place to stay. We felt comfortable in the home, it was a great location, and we’d definitely stay here again."

We will miss it. Just enough space for two. We elected to have joy meet us to show us how to get there. She was big help. The pool is salt and not heated. Was bummed about that. Spacious deck for both sun and shade. We were there for two weeks. Only had one day that electricity went out. Place has back up generator. But when electric goes out whole island so does wifi. So we went to beach that day. If u rent a Jeep from st Thomas and ferry over on car barge. Make sure u get on same company going back. There are more than one. And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves. For Some may be challenging or others fun. Gas / hot deli / grocery store mid way from Cruze bay to coral bay is good. We did a lot of driving around and packed a lunch.

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean"

We would recommend that for those that have never driven in Costa Rica before. We rented a car from Uvita the next day. The roads are steep and curvy but very passable in dry season. The villa is better than the pictures can capture. We were mostly here to see the jungle and birds, wildlife etc. We were pleased with what all there is to see right from the deck. We had monkeys on the deck rail 2 out of the 7 days! Toucans, Aracaris, Tanagers, Honeycreepers, and many more other species daily. The gardener showed a sloth and its baby to us one day in a tree beside the parking area. So cool! Very friendly and helpful service personnel were there upon our arrival. We had power outages every day, but it was only out for 1 or 2 minutes a day. However, I think a back-up generator was being installed while we were there. We had a problem with the pool but Nacho and Lucie were very quick to remedy that even on a weekend. If you are looking for 1st class location and villa this will not disappoint. We would book this again without hesitation if we have the opportunity. Thank you, Lucie and Cameron, for sharing your piece of paradise with our family."

Decorated eclecticly, we were constantly coming across little interesting pieces and flourishes. I won't spoil it for you. One of our favorite spots was a private dining deck open to the bay. We ate most meals there. The private beach access made entering the bay effortless and if you take a short walk along the beach before sunset you can lay on the beach and watch it sink into the Caribbean. If you're a sunrise person the Atlantic beaches are a short distance away. Also our gratitude to Mr and Mrs Williams the caretakers who greeted us on arrival answered our many questions and helped with any issues. They were efficient, friendly and genuinely great people. We had a great time and felt very comfortable. Highly recommend and are planning to return.

It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain. 

Would I recommend this property? IF the electricity is working, I would rate it a 4. If you stay here, pray that the electricity does not go out!"

The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be. 

Finally the biggest concern is that the owners tried to charge us several hundred dollars after the fact for deep cleaning based on ""smoking"" inside the house. None of the family are smokers and so this was definitely not the case."

We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcoholic or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage."

I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted."

The hot tub with a view after skiing is Awesome. The duel floors allow two couples (or couple with kids )to enjoy the place and still have privacy. The owners are very responsive to questions and issues. The garage is very tiny but my Jeep Latitude just fit. Warning! The garage can only be opened from key pad on outside of garage. If power goes out you cannot gain access to the garage or contents until power is restored. Learned that the hard way. I recommend leaving it open just enough to crawl under to manually open if you have a big ski day planned. The kitchen has all the equipment you need to cook your meals and a table for four. TV has great streaming options. The floor heat is very nice and fans are provided for. those who like white noise or a little breeze. Overall a Great place to stay!

It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone."

She was very communicative. She contacted us a few days in advance to provide check-in information and answer any questions we had. She also provided suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We got unlucky with the weather while we were there and were under a weather alert at one point with predicted power outages and Linda dropped off a flashlight and battery-powered lantern for us just in case. She made us feel very welcome and taken care of the entire time. 

The property itself was also very nice. It's a studio in the lower level of a little bungalow, but felt spacious and was comfortably arranged. The bathroom was a nice size (bigger than I expected) and the kitchenette was well-stocked for what we needed. We dined out a lot, but there were plates, silverware, mini fridge, microwave, and toaster oven for leftovers (plus more equipment that we didn't use). 

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property. There were lots of coffee and restaurant options within 15 minutes' driving distance (many within 5 minutes), it was 20-30 minutes to the sites we wanted to see in San Francisco, and 60-90 minutes to nature areas like Muir Woods and Point Reyes. 

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable. 

This property was nice and cozy and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Linda!"

We like to vacation at our own pace while having the views we’ve come to love being at oceanfront. We don’t like the crowds and the tourism side of things so this is perfect if that’s what you enjoy. 
We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. There is a store about 15 minutes south on your left that is well stocked. Prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians owner is a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcohol or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage."
