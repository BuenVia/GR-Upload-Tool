Overall much about the property was fine. 

The main issue is that the property has major fire alarm issues leading to the fire alarm going off multiple times on our second night, meaning we got zero sleep. All of our kids were up the entire night and it really made it difficult to enjoy our experience. 

I understand that issues happen, but we have been offered zero compensation or apology from the property management.

Our stay was lovely & the house was perfect in size for our group of friends & kids . The location was great to 😊

Unfortunately the big room with the single beds had an interesting smell to it & there was quite a few cockroaches in that room but no other rooms in the house.

Overall we loved our stay and would definitely recommend. Had all the facilities and space we required to make everyone’s stay a comfortable and enjoyable one. 

Julls is a fantastic host , very easy to liaise with & kept us well informed on Raglan & updated on road closures and travel alternatives.

major construction

Not sure if the owner actually knows about the major construction going on but it was not even mentioned until after i had booked!! This unit should not be listed to rent until this construction is over !!! It is actually a fire hazard and dangerous plus there is no access to the beach or to the pools or hot tubs or the major pretty balcony that's described on the listing. I'm sure it is great when there is no construction going on but the balcony was literally boarded off you could not step out into the balcony and if there was a fire outside the unit we were locked in. Don't get me wrong this would be a great location and place if this was not currently going on !!! And I understand that during the off season this needs to be done but it needs to be told to people before they rent it I literally had to be moved to another place because of the constant banging people outside of the windows & balcony ..........you could not use any of the amenities and the water coming out of the ice maker was brown. It was not safe. I was moved 2 days after being put in that place which was too long and if I had known one bit of it before I would have never booked.

We ask 1 month before arrival if there was damage 
2 of the 4 guest were assured NO it was taken care of.

The day we arrived received a message from Vacasa saying the roof and lania were damaged. 

The dock was molded looked nothing like the pictures! There were loose boards. They did send someone to clean and stain after we complained.

The pavers going to dock we’re very loose 
Almost fell!! 

Kitchen was NOT equipped with proper utensils 
Rusted knifes in butcher block.
The so called coffee bar is a joke! There are 3 small coffee makers that’s all that’s not a coffee bar!

We had 1 small skillet that was is bad shape! 

We finally got cookware after several days ! 
Th toilet in the 2 bathroom was or had been leaking. 

NO WORKING SMOKE/fire detectors!! 
The beds are VERY hard! 
Pool creeper/cleaner did NOT work 
Screen was missing so pool couldn’t be used! 
Ice maker wasn’t always working!

We received a text saying we had early check in the house was ready…. We arrived 2 hours later 
And the manager and other person was there still getting house ready. 

We said we were disappointed in the property, the manager stated “we were fortunate the house was still there after Ian”

We were clearly lied to by Vacasa! 
After 16 days and many conversations they moved us to a new property! 

The whole vacation was over shadowed and phone conversations and waiting for a response from Vacasa! 

We have pictures of all things stated and more!

fire hazard no hot water

This place was in a great location beautiful home and it was quiet clean to some standards but not to mine. There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

It's a nice and fairly new property that had the added benefit of three plus nice sized, very comfortable bedrooms (Hard to find in Key West). The pool was great and frequently used. There were a number of not well publicized surprises that would make me think twice before renting the property again:

1. At precisely 9:00 am everyday, daily flight sorties commence overhead with fighter jet training exercises. It is nearly to converse while this is happening.

2. The cooking furnishings are fairly spartan for such a property making it near difficult to cook large meals for a group of six. Things that we would otherwise take for granted like cutting boards, salt/pepper, kitchen towels were not to be found. What was there was very limited relative to other comparably priced VRBO's we have rented previously.

3. The one meal we did cook resulted in 30 minutes of smoke alarm hell. Best we could tell the oven vent is not vented to the outside so any minor smoke set them off. Once tripped, the affected ones had to be individually reset.

4. The outside ceiling fans did not function and one had a broken blade which might explain why they were shut off at the breaker.

Overall, there was a lot to like about the house but enough not to like where I probably would not rent again unless some of the items that are able to be remedied were.

lovely location

Honestly this was a lovely property and so very clean and well appointed.
We had a couple of concerns around being unable to get the television to work and the property manager just said they couldn't help with that. It would have been nice to have it going for our stay but this was not the case despite us trying with the property manager to get it going. Also the smoke alarm kept going off due to the battery needing replacing so we just took it down and left it on the table inside doorway so others would not experience it going off all night.
My main concern was the inability to get hold of anyone if needed. We had been made homeless due to flooding in auckland the week prior and requested consideration due to the state of emergency declared in auckland. Tried to get hold of the owners for 3 days prior to our holiday to discuss this but no one was able to get hold of anyone. It just would have been nice to have had an answer as to whether a cancelation or deferral of the booking was possible due to the extreme circumstances, but we ended up going as it was too expensive to lose. This is possibly why the niggly thing with the tv not working was a little more annoying than normal as we were already pretty overwhelmed.

many issues could have been solved with a pre check-in walkthrough...

Upon arrival, the 100-or-so yd dirt driveway was completely covered in ice and snow and showed no attempt at salting or plowing in the last few days. We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place.

many issues could have been solved with a pre check-in walkthrough...

Upon arrival, the 100-or-so yd dirt driveway was completely covered in ice and snow and showed no attempt at salting or plowing in the last few days. We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place. Some of the sheets/comforters were clearly stained with makeup and crusty with what looked like bodily fluids on them... Surely a health and safety concern. The lock on the large TV room door was broken and did not lock. The master bathroom had what looked like puke on the walls.

I'll start by saying that the host was nice and responds quickly and the unit was very clean, however we had many issues with this property. First off, basketball machine and foosball were both broken. There was no air hockey or pinball as indicated in the listing. Kitchen had mix matched plates, not enough knives or bowls, and old scratched pans. Living room furniture was stained and dining chairs were broken. 2 of the 3 bathrooms doors didn't lock and the shower didn't drain.

The trash on the side of the house was overflowing before we arrived. Finally, I was charged a different amount for early check in then what was listed on VRBO and the host changed the check out time then what was agreed upon in the reservation confirmation. Suffice to say, we won't stay here again.

For example, there were no cookie sheets or any oven pans. there were no serving bowls etc or bowl to mix a salad. There were no flippers/spatulas for flipping eggs or pancakes. There were no garbage bags, dish clothes, tea towels, or oven mitts etc. you get one single use shampoo in each of the two bathrooms so make sure you bring your own. There was no battery in the upstairs smoke detector as the battery door was hanging open but I didn't see this until we were leaving so I don’t know if it is hard wired. There were minor defeats to the construction of the house. The location to the theme parks was about 20 minutes which is quite convienient. Security staff was always friendly. This property has no back yard neighbours and looks out to a field/school. It is not close to the pool. It’s a 10 minute walk to the pool. The parking lot is on the opposite side of the building entrance to this suite. So you would have to walk around the building with your bags.

The property was fairly as described but we had numerous issues with the home and the management was unable to fix them.

When we took a picture of the empty ceiling mount and sent it to the management we were told that the units were beeping and they could not identify the problem so a few weeks ago they removed all of the smoke detectors and put them in the laundry room cupboard. Unbelievable! When we arrived at the home, the gas was shut off to the exterior of the home and we could not get the pool, hot tub, grill or fire pit to work and we had paid $400 for the use of the fire pit and $800 for the pool! Management was insistent that we were not following the instructions for the mechanicals and did nothing. Since no one was coming to fix this issue we took time from our vacation to investigate and found that the exterior shut off valve was closed. We do not feel the pool and spa fees were properly disclosed to a renter before officially renting the home. The ice maker did not work and when reported the manager he turned it on and water froze all over the interior of the freezer but never made ice. His ""fix"" was just o turn it back off. The garbage cans on the home's exterior were full and we needed to notify the management so we were not charged for excessive garbage! It was these and other issues that took away from our enjoyment of our vacation. Management outright lied numerous times.

We liked the location and amenities of the cottage but apparently the gas fireplace is not vented properly. We used it for 1 1/2 hours one evening and then turned it off and went to bed at 11:30pm. At 1am the smoke alarm in the cottage was going off so we jumped out of bed and looked for the problem. We saw nothing so we opened doors and turned on the fans. The alarm eventually silenced and we went back to bad. About 5 minutes later a fire truck pulled up and firemen were knocking on our door. They checked our carbon monoxide levels which were high especially upstairs.Again at their insistence we opened doors and windows and put ceiling fans on for about 30 minutes.After a bit they felt it was safe to close doors and return to bed. The realty company called at the time the firemen were there and asked us not to use the fireplace again. We sure did not! We never heard another word from the realty company. My advice is to rent a different cottage unless you ask specifically if the fireplace venting has been repaired in Garden Cottage 01. Maybe even bring your own carbon monoxide monitor!

The alarm eventually silenced and we went back to bad. About 5 minutes later a fire truck pulled up and firemen were knocking on our door. They checked our carbon monoxide levels which were high especially upstairs.Again at their insistence we opened doors and windows and put ceiling fans on for about 30 minutes.After a bit they felt it was safe to close doors and return to bed. The realty company called at the time the firemen were there and asked us not to use the fireplace again. We sure did not! We never heard another word from the realty company. My advice is to rent a different cottage unless you ask specifically if the fireplace venting has been repaired in Garden Cottage 01. Maybe even bring your own carbon monoxide monitor!

Had a nice stay here with my husband and baby girl. Very quiet and the whole place was very clean! Liked that the place was so easy to find and had parking right out front. 

Two things to be aware of. Be wary that the place gets very warm at night so turn down the thermostat before you go to bed. Second, there were not any smoke detectors!!! They had all been removed?? When I realized we had already stayed the night but it's scary that we were there with our baby with no smoke detectors. Hope they get put back before the next guests stay.

sort of a let down.

I wanted to love this place but property management is lacking unfortunately. Our second night the smoke detector started beeping due to a low battery. No big deal but they did not care to fix it during our stay. I wrote Kaelyn and called the management company. Both said they would send someone out and never did which made it very hard to sleep for our toddler and us. I called multiple times and left messages. Removing the battery did not help. Maintenance came by for another unit and said Kaelyn and the company had not told them about it and they shrugged and left.
Linens were not fully restocked for our arrival and we caught and removed several roaches during our stay. There are about 15 roach boxes set out all over the place so it must be something they are working to resolve. Hopefully? 
Parking is first come first serve and very tight spaces. If your car can’t fit or there’s not a space, Kaelyn recommends parking in a Med center parking garage for $13/day. Street parking is tow away.
The neighborhood is nice and the location is great. Bring your own towels, someone that doesn’t mind bugs, and hope you never need management. (Check the reviews for the other units and this one on the competitor’s website.)

terrible experience with this host!!
----
This is literally the first negative review I have ever posted in my life. Typically if I am not satisfied with an experience, I just don’t leave a review. I am making an exception in this case because this host scammed me out of $185 (which I am currently disputing).

The beach and setting are nice. The building is old and dilapidated. Unpleasant odors in the unit and around the building. Door locks/scanner for fitness room were broken. Smoke or air detector in unit was constantly beeping for no apparent reason. There is construction in process, so it’s loud, and reserved parking spot is regularly used by others. Regular work truck traffic also blocks entry and parking. Shower has very weak water pressure and takes a long time to heat up. Pool is tiny. No hot tub.

I would have ignored all of this however, if the host hadn’t stuck me with a completely BOGUS “cushion damage/laundering” fee of $185 after my stay. I made multiple attempts to communicate with him regarding the erroneous charge, to try and get some clarity on the matter, but was completely ignored. There is absolutely no way we caused any damage to his cushions! We barely used them and everything looked just the way we found it when we left. The host lives on the mainland. I know this because I mailed his parking pass back to him. So, he is either dishonest OR he got bad info from his property manager. The fact that he wouldn’t communicate regarding the matter is unacceptable to me. 

I definitely won’t stay here again and would tell others to AVOID THIS HOST!

El Faro is a lovely complex, great location & beautiful pool. Unit 309 could be fabulous but needs investment in updates. From the moment we arrived there were issues. The light when you enter the unit was not working & smoke detectors were beeping every 60 to 90 seconds. The living room carpet was very dirty as was the master bedroom comforter. The wonderful rep from Five Star Mgmt. came in on Sunday night to pull the batteries from the three fire alarms to stop the beeping. Unfortunately there was one more unidentified beep that kept beeping all through our first night. It was identified the following day coming from the dishwasher. That same day the washing machine was found to be broke. A maintenance guy came in around the same time to address the sewer smell in the master bath which the previous tenant had complained about. It was never fixed. The bath towels were the quality you would use to wash your car. The balcony is beautiful overlooking the beach & ocean but very little furniture to enjoy spending time relaxing. No loungers to enjoy this large space. A dining table & chairs on the small part of the wrap around balcony with one broken chair. The larger balcony had one small plastic rattan two person bench, a small table & three dining chairs. This large space was practically empty. Clocks not working due to old batteries and more. The staff at El Faro & Five Star Mgmt were wonderful & helpful. Needs some owner investment & could be 5 Star.

nice stay overall but lacks attention to detail and management
----
This is a nice home in a nice neighborhood, quiet and the price is good. But there is a decent lack of attention to detail and management oversight. 

I'm a property manager of vacation rentals so I'm the first to say I'm pickier than most guests. It is nicely decorated but not functional. Managers/owners should stay in their rentals as a test run and see it from the guests perspective.

Pretty cobblestone entrances are for home owners and designers, not vacation rentals. No one wants to drag several heavy bags of luggage over that. Especially with your elderly parent, uneven surfaces are a hazard. It was in the 40s that week, the house was freezing upon arrival and we accidentally hit the security/fire alarm trying to turn on the heat and that went off for 10 minutes. I wrote the manager who didn't seem to know there was an alarm or how to turn it off. No notes anywhere on how to operate things. The Hot and Cold valve is backwards in the shower; try waiting for that to heat up while stand there freezing cold and naked. The master bed frame broke making my sister in law to sleep on the couch freezing because no one could figure out the heater mechanism on the wall. Way too difficult to operate. And calling it a 4 bedroom is a stretch, its a 3 bedroom with a game room. 

We asked for help but didn't get it on the items of most concern alarm/bedframe/heater. Nice house, mediocre management. Sorry! There's actually more but Vrbo is cutting me off :)

It was one of the more reasonably priced properties relatively close to KW. Also had one of the more flexible cancellation policies and allow for shorter bookings.

Queen bed slept comfortably. 4 pillows & extra bedding available. Closet houses A/C mechanical. Dresser / wire shelving sufficient storage. Iron (didn't see a board)

Pullout sofa, some might not like the fabric but we were fine. Sufficient space. One TV free channels, Hulu, Netflix, Prime, etc.

Bathroom small clean, tub/shower was new / well maintained, water was hot quick, hairdryer.

Kitchen as advertised limited supplies. No dishwasher & requested to wash before leaving. Paper plates & cottage silverware minimized washing.

Screened porch table with 4 chairs, beach chair.

Neither pool felt heated. Behind cottage clean, no handrail. Several chairs / lounges. Recently drained for maintenance. Building had coin laundry, life vest for the free kayak. Both are available one felt a little intrusive in the ""Main House"" backyard, had a handrail. Also the beach area.

disappointing and deceptive

Unlike other places we have rented, there was no friendly welcome to the home. Instead, there were multiple signs telling us what not to do! 
""Heated pool"" listed in description of this house and in list of amenities. We quickly learned it was NOT heated and to heat it we would be charged an additional $80/day and it would take 3 days to warm up. Since a heated pool was one of the reasons we choose this listing, we were all extremely disappointed and felt incredibly deceived! 
The description and pictured of this house showed a large game room which added to the appeal of this home to our family. We quickly learned that this was also not as described! The golf game did not work. The video game worked on practice mode only. If you wanted to play a regular game, you needed to PAY! Next to the dart game was a bowl filled with broken darts. 
The entire house was well furnished but tired and worn. For the amount we paid in rent there was no wow. Minimal selection of glassware, cheap silverware, filthy carpeting, worn paint, missing smoke alarm, patched areas not painted. There is not enough space to explain all of our reasons for disappointment.
On a positive note, the putting green was nice and the home is in a great neighborhood.

the house doesn't look like the pictures lower your expectations. the pictures are from years ago.

I am writing this to leave the most accurate representation of what the house was like when I stayed from the 06/01/2023-06/02/2023. The home could use a lot of work to bring it up to the standard that the pictures would like you to believe you're walking into. Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken

-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay.

the house doesn't look like the pictures lower your expectations. the pictures are from years ago.

I am writing this to leave the most accurate representation of what the house was like when I stayed from the 06/01/2023-06/02/2023. The home could use a lot of work to bring it up to the standard that the pictures would like you to believe you're walking into. Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken
-Most of the house windows were dirty also covered in spider webs
-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided 
-All the beds were very very hard, also terrible pillows, and beds were not made properly
-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry

terrible mgmt & house issues
----
Worst stay ever. Fire alarm detectors took 5 days to correct. Constant beeping night and day was torture! GFI outlets didn’t work downstairs, no cold water downstairs, and ZERO running water throughout the whole house the last night and morning. The local management was absolutely terrible in communicating and even had 2 days where we had to go back home to meet a contractor that never arrived 2 days in a row. Our first 2 days we spent away from the home because the beeping was so obnoxious and we were hopeful the issue would be corrected soon. Nope! The local management even questioned the beeping when I first reported it because “they just had someone change the batteries” (come to find out the detectors were hardwired and trying to find a signal so the contractor had to remove the hardwiring). 
 I understand issues arise, but to be questioned, ghosted, and left without resources such as water was absolutely unacceptable. Vacasa did not provide the services I worked so hard to save up and pay for.

poor management tarnished very nice property

The property itself was as pictured in the VRBO description, although the bedrooms were smalker than picturedand the spaces not as deluxe as they appeared. The fire shown in the fireplace was mis-represented, as it was a wood fireplace with no wood, kindling,or ever fire lighting materials on the property. The main problem with the property was the extremely poor property management, not the property itself. The entry codes provided for the door lock did not work, leaving us out in the 30 degree cold while we called the out-of-town manahement company. They gave us another code for the door, which did not work. We finally got a single key out of a lock box, but the door would deadbolt automatically after a few seconds. This meant we could be locked out completely just by going out to the car while leaving the key inside. Once inside, the wifi code provided was completely wrong. In fact, we had to tell the management company what the correct codes were. We complained to the management company about 3 inches of trecherous ice on the stairsteps. They told us it was our responsibility to remove, that we should 'look for some salt in the house', and we should have brought our own snow-shovel. Finally, we put a bag of popcorn in the microwave. In 90 seconds, it burst the popcorn bag into flames and filled the house with smoke, setting off the smoke alarm. Other than these initial problems with management, we honestly enjoyed our stay at the property. It was clean and charming.

DRAFT REVIEW FOR THE HOUSE, please edit/add!

Positives of the house and our stay: great location to Deer Valley resort, large living areas, and beautiful views.

Unfortunately the negatives vastly outnumbered the positives. It started Wednesday when we realized warm water was a luxury and hard to come by. Barely any of the sinks and showers produced hot water and if you were lucky to get it, it went away almost immediately. 

Thursday we had a toilet that would not flush. In a house with 8 adults and 8 kids, you really rely on all toilets to work properly!

The hiccups continued into Friday night when we were abruptly awoken at midnight by blaring music from the living room wall speakers. We thought the house was possessed! None of us had connected to the sonos speaker system so we have no idea how it started playing out of nowhere! 

The nighttime disasters culminated the next night/morning. At 340am on Sunday the fire alarm in the master bedroom began to ring. We confirmed There was no fire, no emergency. It rang for 5 mins and stopped. Then restarted and stopped. The ringing continued every few mins for two hours!!! It could be heard throughout the home and everyone’s sleep was ruined. We called the emergency after hours phone number for assistance to no avail. No call back, no response. This is unacceptable! 

We had a terrible experience at this house and with Opulent Vacations and will not be returning.

We were not asking for the world, just the basics.

not a good first impression

I booked this place back in December for some of us college softball moms heading to Houston to cheer on our daughters. I kept checking the day before and day off for checking in instructions. Check in was 4:00 pm and we got to property at 6:30pm. By this time I had messaged property contact on VRBO link twice and heard nothing. While sitting in driveway I called. She was unaware we were booked for the long weekend (4 nights). After seeing we were booked she ended up giving me the code for the garage, but didn’t have the front door code as the cleaning person changes it. She said if she knew we were coming, the property would have been freshened up since it had been a week since last occupants. Well she should have known we had the reservation as the property manager. We walked in and the house was so cold. Thermostat was at 51. I turned the thermostat up and called back the property manager. She told me the house would heat up fine. The upstairs did, but not the main floor. After waking up the next day, main floor was still so chilly. Smoke alarms were chirping entire night as well. I let Ruth know via text. It wasn’t until 8:00 that evening that she and her husband showed up with a Space heater and changed the smoke alarm batteries. 
A light bulb was out in the shared bathroom upstairs, cobwebs on the corner of the wooden stairs, and multiple stains on the comforter in the bedroom I was in. Mirrors would have been nice to have in bedrooms.

very dispointing - windy city fail

My first negative VRBO review ever! 

While the access to the building was easy, upon entering our unit #304 - we were overwhelmed with the smell of gas that hit us when we entered. 

Having to cover our eyes upon entering, quickly found the stove burner slightly turned, and emitting gas. Not knowing how long that had been on - we quickly contacted you, were ready to contact the fire department, turned off the stove - and had to open all the windows and doors for a long while until the smell dissipated, then flee outside as we felt very unsafe.
 
Not a very warm welcome to Sonder property. 

Also, the unit was not what we expected in a scene of care and cleanliness. A few things: 

Bathtub in the first bath had a huge drain issue, and did not drain, leaving me to stand in gross water - then the next day the shower was so slippery from the residual soap - that it was super dangerous. 

The dishes in the cabinet were dirty - literally feel like a guest may have loaded the dishwasher - not run it, then housekeeping thought it was clean and put it away. So disgusting. 

The sheets in the guest bathroom appeared to have dried blood stains on them. 

NOTE: I reached out directly to the property managment company, Sonder directly to address this before sharing this review. The first attempt went completely ingnored, and the second attempts months later was met with a sorry, we will do better next time. Sorry, for me - there will certainly not be a next time.

great location. bad experience.

Rented this condo for 5 days for my children and a few of their friends to ski. The location of this unit is excellent. It’s super close to the slopes and we had a good view from the balcony to see our kids going down the slope. It was right next to the laundry room too, which was really convenient. There was a good selection of cookware and dishes in the unit, as well as a blender and a crockpot. The weren’t very many spoons/forks but we brought our own plasticware and disposable cups/plates/bowls so we were set. The listing indicated there was a Keurig, but there was not - there was a Mr. Coffee brewer so the k-cups we brought with us were useless. 

I’ve never stayed at any of the other condos in this complex so I cannot say how this one compares to the others, I can only share my experience/observations. 

Between beds, bunks and a pullout sofa, it slept eight. There was only enough seating for four people unless you used the barstools. The beds weren’t terrible, but they weren’t great either. Probably depends on what you’re used to. I’m told the bunks slept terrible. 

First thing we noticed when we arrived was the smoke alarm just inside the entry was hanging by wires and was covered with a plastic bag. Having no idea what was going on, we left it as it was. In addition to that, the toilet in main bath was shimmed on one side and didn’t appear to be properly attached to the floor, as it sometimes lifted off floor if you moved a certain way while using it. There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again.

There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again.

Very easy to find and parking was available right in front of the condo. upon entering there was strong smell of smoke due to someone not opening the flue while having a fire. It aired out after awhile tho and we were happy to be able to have a fire every night (with the flue OPEN).
Kitchen had everything we needed to cook our meals including a dishwasher. 
Beds were comfortable and both rooms had tvs.
For an older building you can tell the owners are trying to update everything and keep it well kept up.
Snow removal on the property was fine and we never had a problem getting in or out even though we had a ton of snow while there. 
Can't wait to come back for our yearly trip!

It is cold in the bottom level two bedrooms and hot in the top level were the master bedroom is. The property was clean and well kept. It is not a ski in ski out property. There is a short walk to the end of the parking lot to ski down to a lift, and a much longer walk back from Moonlight Lodge. I have certainly had longer walks and you do not have to get a shuttle. There are good views of the mountains from the different levels in the condo. It would have been nice to have access to Moonlight Lodge (members only) for food as it is an 11 minute drive to the base with limited options and town must be 25 minutes. Trade offs is what it is about. Over all we were very satisfied with the property and the folks a Stay Montana were very helpful.

The outdoor furniture very rusty, patio was filthy, paint cans in b/r closet, horrible linens/bed pillows (only one set of sheets for MB), horrible pitted pans for cooking, tupperware needs to be replaced, sofa needs to be replaced-was shedding feathers/sunk almost to floor when you sat on it, dining room table very very shaky-afraid to sit there to eat, no parking passes for guests (even though I was allowed two spots). I took pictures of everything that I mentioned and will gladly forward them to you if you want them. Also my opinion of Florida Vacay Rentals is that they are a very poor management co. I've always used VRBO for ALL of my travel needs and never have I ever experienced anything like this. As a matter of fact I am a preferred guest with other owners. For what I paid for this condo and the experience that I had it is a travesty.

The TV in the great room is nice.but is a Sling tv with no information on how it is to be used. The utensils in the kitchen were inexpensive. The decor needs attention. It has a nice backyard but I did not need a backyard. The bathrooms are antiquated with old tubs and shower curtains and poor water pressure. It had a garage but no garage opener therefore useless to me. . I had a friend stop by who owns VRBOs and could not believe it was a VRBO or the rate charged in that neighborhood, I would not recommend it to anyone. The owners were nice but really need to invest more in it to continue to command such a price . I did leave a night early.

Finding the entrance to the property was very difficult as the front gate was not opening and nobody even mentioned previously or put a note in front that the entrance is from back side. Wasted lots of time there. The property is very very old and had issues with water supply. Nothing was clear to us when we get in, the we read notes on the fridge regarding water switch and that the front gate is blocked. How can someone know that the gate is blocked on their first arrival if you stick that note inside the property??? The front gate area was stinking a lot. The fire alarm started making noise suddenly early morning around 4:30 am when everyone were sleeping and then automatically turned off in 4-8 minutes and ruined everyone’s sleep. There was no smoke there and it was malfunctioning. This happened several times actually. The only thing we all like was the area nearby. The beach was great but the property was horrible, considering the price they charged for 2 nights.

Owl's Nest is set on a lovely wooded lot, in sight of other houses but with beautiful views of private wooded areas.

The house comes equipped with everything you'd need for a great stay. Beds and couches were comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped and the place has games, a pool table, TVs, etc. 

We had two significant issues during our visit. The first relates to the temperature of the house, which we were told is at 55 degrees when not in use (in theory, we're all for this for energy conservation purposes). But it was colder than that when we arrived. Guests are supposed to use two built-in wall units to heat the house and aren't supposed to use the in-room radiators. This was really impractical. WITH the radiators and two space heaters, it took about 24 hours for the house to get up to a comfortable temperature (temps outside were between 20-35 degrees at first). One in-room bedroom radiator wasn't working, so that bedroom was out of commission for us. 

The second issue was with the upstairs fireplace. After checking to see that the damper was open and creating a good draft through the flue, our fire lit well but spewed an unusual amount of smoke into the house - so much so that we had to extinguish it. My guess is the chimney hadn't been cleaned properly. 

Raj was extremely responsive and helpful throughout. He seemed genuinely surprised about the heat and fire issues and tried asking around to see if anything could be done. Upon seeing that the temps were to drop to below zero on our third night, he had an extra space heater shipped to us. And upon being unable to sort out the fireplace issues, he volunteered to refund us for one out of our four nights. This was greatly appreciated, and he seems committed to making his guests' experiences positive. Five-star service, support, and communication. 

I will note a couple of other small issue that arose. One is the hot tub, which was inviting and warm but not quite 'hot' (though I will mention the weather was very cold outside). The other was that though there is a travel crib available, sheets for it were not. Not something I care about a lot, but others might.

Given Raj's sincere efforts to help and improve this experience, I expect future guests enjoy staying here even more than we did. But given how many options there are in the Poconos and how expensive they all are, we'd probably choose somewhere else next time.

The condo was nice and big and spacious for my wife and I. We had a couple of minor issues with power outage, no water, but Michael was there to assist us & was extremely helpful and accommodating! The condo was a great place to stay and look forward to returning on my next trip! Five stars!

cousin’s trip

Loved the location and property. Loved the view from the second floor and the hot tub was a hit with our group. 

On our first night it was below 58 degrees inside the condo and we couldn’t get the heat to work. We tried everything to make it turn on, we looked for instructions on how to set it, but could not find any or get it to work. Since it was 11:00 pm we had to call first thing in the morning and we learned they had a power outage the day before and needed to reset all units. They came over right away and took care of it.

I would have loved seeing the beautiful view from the master, but the electronic blinds did not go up. When I asked the maintenance man (who was there fixing our heat) about it he said they were waiting on a part to fix them. That was a huge disappointment considering what we paid for the view. 

Overall, the communication was excellent from the property management and we loved the bungalow! Looking forward to a return trip!

another great stay in richmond’s art district
----
This was my third time staying in one of Mr. Szafranski’s units and the unit was just as great as the other two. Great and clean space, super comfy bed and great set up to work and relax. Walkable neighborhood close to VCU and restaurants/coffee shops. I enjoyed the space and neighborhood. I hope Mr. Szafranski appreciates returning customers like myself, although I couldn’t tell from his very canned and bland communications. I can live with that though because the space was as pictured and promised. But it would be nice to feel your returning business is appreciated! There was also another communication issue I was very disappointed with and still am (the power was out for a few hours one day; I wasn’t informed in advance although they were aware it would be out). My main disappointment was that I received a response about the issue 13 hours after I sent a message and it didn’t include any note of acknowledgment of my inconvenience. Even though the issue was out Mr. Szafranski’s control, a simple sorry for your inconvenience goes along with customer interactions. I did get in contact with his assistant during the power outage and he said he meant to tell me when I checked in the day prior. I understand we all are human and things slip our minds but again the disappointment was that Mr. Szafranski replied in the Vrbo app 13 hours later and just said we understand the power went out but thankfully it came back on in a few hours. Yes thankfully indeed and luckily I didn’t need to work early that day but Heaven help me if I had a ventilator or respirator that needed electricity. Again, just a simple “although this was out of our control, we are sorry for the inconvenience” would have went a long way. Put a bad taste in my mouth but I still rate them high (they emphasize that anything less than a 5 star rating “hurts” them) because the unit was so comfortable and served my purposes. Don’t know if I will stay again because I am not sure my business is appreciated but for other travelers considering Mr. Szafranski’s units, they are as pictured/described and are quite comfortable.

It was located on a steep, poorly paved street. It is definitely not a place that is for people with mobility problems. 
We arrived at 7 PM. There was no one is greet us. I text the host and he informed me that he text the lock box number. I never received the number. The agreement was that someone was to meet us if it was before 9 PM. I was frustrated with the whole process. The host finally arrived to open the key box after my husband and I tried to open the box that had very small numbers & was located in a dark corner. 
The property was a dark, concrete affair with uncomfortable furniture. It had a good bed, shower head, and laundry. The kitchen was marginal. 
We had two requests from the host. We asked for a spare keys, have the stove fixed and the electricity went out. The only thing addressed was the electricity. 
Another item that would be appreciated is if they would provide drinking water. It was very inconvenient to haul water up a steep hill.
In short, we were very disappointed with host and property. We ended up renting anther place for 2 night of our 7 day stay.

the property management company is horrible to deal with

We arrived Friday late afternoon.We notified Dunlop management at 10AM on Saturday morning that there was no hot water in 1 of the 2 showers. There was an issue with a plumber showing up who said that no one was there, but we were clearly there. A representative from Dunlop made it sound as if we would have to pay for them to come back out. At 11:30 we were told that someone would be out at noon. A plumber did not arrive until noon the NEXT DAY. On our last night at around 5:15 our power went out. At 5:55 we were told that we would have to move to another ""upgraded"" location. It was a hassle to pack up our perishable food that we were cooking for our farewell dinner that night let alone trying to find our things in the dark. The new location was not an upgrade. We did not have any Ocean view: it was 3 blocks from the water, nor could we hear the waves as we could at the other location. It only had 1 & 1/2 baths, so we were back to one shower for 3 women. We ended up not being able to eat our dinner until 11PM that night. I sent a text to Dunlop stating that we were dissatisfied and why at 6:52PM and was told by text that the ""Office Manager will call you first thing in the morning"". She did not call until 12. She was very defensive and rude from the beginning of the conversation: even questioning the ocean view since it was “dark”. She was constantly interrupting us when we were trying to explain why were dissatisfied. I have rented 100’s of properties all over the world.

What can I say about Mike & April and their beautiful West Dover/Mount Snow accommodations, except absolutely, unequivocally fabulous. They are kind, generous, and communicative, and their home is perfect--clean, tidy, organized, well-suited for families, great local facilities, and close to the mountain (ski-on/off).

Why am I so glowing in my review? Well, we had a snafu in our original plans. Two families (4 adults and 6 young children) checked into a different house. One snowstorm later (great for skiing, less-so for our housing), our original home was without electricity, running water, or heat. The management company promised us we'd ""be taken care of"", but by 6 PM the power wasn’t on and the management company abdicated their responsibility--we were stuck and left homeless.

After a quick Vrbo search, we came upon Mike & April's abode. They quickly responded and lent a hand, made their home available that same night, and immediately got the house cleaned/prepped. Within hours, our travel group was nestled into Mike & April's warm, welcoming home.

The rest of our stay was blessedly uneventful with 4 comfortable nights at Mike & April's. It fit our 2 families easily, was well-maintained, and truly made our vacation! Throughout our time, Mike & April were available for anything we may have needed and made us feel welcome and at home.

All-in-all, I cannot recommend them more. Thank you Mike & April for saving our vacation and making it even better!!

Jolie petite maison en RDC avec une petite cour. La maison est bien rénovée et bien située. Elle est à 5 mn du carrefour market et 10 mn à pieds du port. Le quartier est assez calme et l’on se gare dans la rue devant la maison. Par contre pas de pression d’eau et pas d’eau chaude exepté un peu le soir. Attention sur l’annonce il est indiqué 2 toilettes mais un seul fonctionne et il est dans la salle de bain. L’autre est condamné. Nous avions choisi cette location pour avoir deux toilettes et avons donc été très déçus à l’arrivée. La plaque de cuisson comporte 2 feux gaz et 2 électrique. Dommage que le gaz ne fonctionne pas car le soir il y a des coupures d’électricité. J’espère que la propriétaire va résoudre le problème de toilette ou modifier la description de son logement.

Pretty little house in the DRC with a small courtyard. The house is well renovated and well located. It is 5 minutes from the Carrefour Market and 10 minutes walk from the port. The neighborhood is quite quiet and we get in the street in front of the house. On the other hand, no water pressure and no hot water exerted a little in the evening. Watch out for the advertisement it is indicated 2 toilets but only one works and it is in the bathroom. The other is sentenced. We had chosen this rental to have two toilets and were therefore very disappointed on arrival. The baking sheet has 2 gas and 2 electric lights. Too bad the gas does not work because in the evening there are power cuts. I hope the owner will solve the toilet problem or modify the description of her accommodation.

Receiving our concerns and complaints did us no good while we stayed there. We complained regarding the heat and electricity not working from the 1st night. 

Being transparent would’ve been letting us know that there would not be efficient electricity and heat provided to all the rooms. There are basic expectations for a rental, such as a roof, electricity, heat, and walls. These are not items that any renter should “reach out and ask questions or be concerned about before booking” 
Should I have also reached out and asked before I arrived if there was a roof? Electricity and heat are basic needs that should have been met every time someone rents a home in a place as cold as Mammoth. Unless you specifically state in your description of the home that heat and electricity MAY NOT be available at all times, which it was not. 
I wish I looked at the reviews before I rented because I am obviously not the first person to complain of the exact same two things the breaker feeling, which means no electricity and heat not working properly. 

“Greatly apologizing my for the inconvenience and difficulties” of being cold and lacking electricity is not ok. “Promising to have this issue resolved in the future”does not help me, because I will never stay here again. Neither is “Feeling my great disappointment” 
We stayed there cold, and lacking electricity because there weren’t any other places to stay. 

Having basic necessities such as heat, and electricity in Mammoth is something that should not be “looked into” it should be mandatory and MUST at all times. We all left the house and weekend sniffling and feeling as if we were on the verge of being sick. 
A reputable rental site such as VRBO without electricity and heat should never be allowed in temperatures as cold as this. 

I would like to be fully refunded rather than apologized to. If not I will have no choice other than to further escalate my complaint, or speak to my attorney.

check in process… the address given to you by VRBO is not of this unit and you had to text the owner for checking in as it was never provided. the whole process is very shady as he gives you the address and tells you to bypass management, to a location of a hidden key (he will send you a video) and that key is not secured in any way… anyone has access to it or can find it. You then get the keys of the unit which are tracked meaning you are tracked by a Tile. (Mind you this unit is specifically stated for bachelorette parties) 

Unit over all is nice, def not meant for the number of people indicated you will trip over each other with all the cots and no room to walk! 
Rules are listed everywhere as if you are all ready going to break something…. Do not expect any amenities…Decor is nice. 

The building is all short term rental so be prepared for drunken knockers as we did two of the nights!

We were there Thurs - Sunday and the power went out, he didn’t have anything to say or help… and we are on the 32nd floor! 

Checking out, we did as the rules said, throw towels in and put the keys back where they all were… 

Tues- he sends nasty messages about us ripping blinds off the wall and charges us fees for this… we were a group of 3 on a girls trip so it’s safe to assume we were not throwing any ragers! Mind you we checked Sun and the key is in a very public location. We also asked for proof as he had two sets of blinds and one was not fully installed. 
No proof…

false location on map, injury from leaking toilet, fireplace broken!

The property was really cute and nicely decorated, but we experienced one issue after another during our stay and management didn’t seem to care. 

Spent our whole first night trying to fix the fireplaces (neither worked). Called/texted the property manager several times before getting a reply. It was close to 10pm before we were able to negotiate and convince them to send maintenance. He got one indoor fire working but the outside one was broken. He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often. 

Next day we noticed the bathroom in the room on the right has no power outlet. Ironically, there is a hair dryer though.
The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far). 
Got home after a long day and ran to the bathroom (long shuttle ride) just to slip on a pool of water and dislocate my knee! Water was dripping out of the back of the toilet tank. I turned off the water and called/texted management for help. No one even responded until the next day! 

VBRO told me the host would contact me about our issues. It’s been over a week and no one has reached out. Worst trip ever!!

I stayed at Erard's apartment for 4 nights and it gave the sanctuary I needed after a full day of walking around Paris. It's very well-situated and the metro and Carrefour grocery are just steps away, not to mention restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood. As an American, I appreciated the amenities that I'm used to - a larger fridge, an LG washer/dryer, fast internet, an air purifier etc. Erard and Luis were very responsive when there was an unexpected power outage in the apartment. One thing to bear in mind - there is a hotel across the street and there will be some noise, usually of people talking, coming into the bedroom late into the night. However, it is not something that bothered me or my sleep as I am used to living in a big, vibrant city. I would definitely stay there again!

And what’s with the weird huge light equipment in the bedroom? The place looked shady as hell! There were no clean towels or bed sheets supplied. No fresh toiletries were provided. The living room floor was sticky and all the carpets were dirty. The bathtub was dirty and the shower was broken . There were no power outlet available for the TV. Network name was not provided and none of the available network was accessible with the password provided. There was only 1 queen bed, so the listing was totally off chart for 5 guests. This is the worst place ever we had to spend a night. And we would rather sleep on the streets of Atlanta if we didn’t have a baby with us. IT WAS DISGUSTING! And to top it all, our baby caught some kind of nasty flu, God knows what kind of germs he caught from that trashy apartment! This place is charging 176$ per night for this??? we feel like we’ve been scammed!

Gosh, I hate to leave bad reviews but we couldn’t wait to leave this place. Not how you want to feel on vacation. The listing said the unit was newly renovated, it wasn’t. There was peeling paint, peeling leather couches, rust on metal items from the humidity. I wipe down the counters whenever I go somewhere and there was lots of hair and dust on the master bathroom counter. The 2 out of 3 of the toilets overflowed, and when we asked for help cleaning the floors from it the owner didn’t respond. Puerto Rico has rolling power outages and unfortunately we also had a loss of power for 12 hours. Other units still had power so I’m not sure if this was an isolated event or they had generators, but it was very inconvenient, especially with 2 small children including a baby. There was also visible mold, which is a big health issue. Would not stay here again or recommend.

Upon our arrival to the property, we did not have the rental we reserved someone else was staying in the unit we ended up getting the blue one, which was not a real difference, but we had planned the orange. Then after we were in the property, we were locked in by the gate that was jammed, and we couldn't leave until after 11PM. Which was one whole night gone. The next day was my best friend's birthday so of course we woke up early to start the day with breakfast and some sightseeing. When we returned to change for her birthday dinner the power was out! We were told that it was a power outage for the whole aera. So, we had to reschedule our plans for her B-day being that we couldn't get ready. On Sunday we had a stopped-up toilet that was flooding, and the tub was backing up. Notified host and was told Maintenace would be over to fix it immediately. We left and started with our day stayed gone all day. We were contacted by the host around 7pm saying that they couldn't fix the bathroom until the next day, but they would give us access to another room to use the bathroom. Which I responded was crazy begin that we are two women, and you want us to leave the apartment and go to another apartment to use the bathroom. The bathroom was left a mess in our unit. I also notified the host of the bathroom being a mess. Host stated that he would see if he could move us to another unit being that he didn't know the bathroom was left a mess, but we never heard from him again that night. We were also accused of flushing baby wipes down the toilet which was the reason they said the toilet and tub was backing up. We did not flush baby wipes down any toilet. Of course, after this I reached out to VRBO Support, but they were no help, only saying they would reach out to the host letting him know my complaints and he should be in touch with me. The host was in contact with me but for my complaints just to let me know the Maintenance team would be coming to fix the problem. I asked the host if he had heard from VRBO Support, but he said he didn't know what I was talking about. The issues were fixed in time for my best friend and I to go to her re-planned birthday dinner on our last night in Houston. I would not book this property being that the host is not any help when you have problems. I understand things happen but then you have to be responsible and accountable for your property.

The important things first: Jenny is an excellent host, all communication was quick and easy. The house met all our needs and the location was what we were looking for (quiet, good space, and out-of-the-way). 

Caveat: we stayed Dec-Jan, winter months, no idea what summer is like in Rockaway Beach!

This is the longest we've stayed at a single place (almost 2 months), so we were wary, it was a big gamble. But, the house was a nice surprise. Great wifi, plenty of space for those rainy days when you can't go out, better than average tools in the kitchen, and deer, ducks, egrets, more birds, visiting the pond next door (literally, outside the porch). The neighborhood was quiet, the beach is walking distance (we did that a lot, it's a great walking beach), there's hiking in the hill to the back (did that a lot too, no seems to make use of it, even though hikers are welcome, never saw anyone else there). 

We even survived the huge storm of December just fine, although things outside didn't fare as well (BBQ grill, chairs and table went flying). 64mph winds will do that! We lost power for 24 hours (we actually expected it to be longer), and Jenny had warned us it might cut out. Either we lucked out or things have gotten much better in Rockaway, but that was the only time we lost power.

As for Rockaway Beach, if you're looking for restaurants and shopping in the winter... not gonna happen! It's a typical tourist town, beholden to the summer months, so not much open. It's exactly what we expected, so no surprise. Stock up in Tillamook or visit Astoria and the Costco, you should be good to go.

If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, quiet place (in the winter, at least), with a great host, this is an excellent house.

As for Rockaway Beach, if you're looking for restaurants and shopping in the winter... not gonna happen! It's a typical tourist town, beholden to the summer months, so not much open. It's exactly what we expected, so no surprise. Stock up in Tillamook or visit Astoria and the Costco, you should be good to go.

If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, quiet place (in the winter, at least), with a great host, this is an excellent house.

We did enjoy our stay with one major problem. Management company didn’t take care of the problems we had. Asked for pool to be heated, charged my credit card, and never heated the pool. Still waiting for credit. No power in one bedroom. They said electrician never showed up. Very unhappy about lack of “personal “ communications.

great house but has issues

We came on a Friday night and everything was lovely. The door wasn’t locked (the deadbolt seemed like it hasn’t properly engaged). The beds were very creeky but comfortable. We woke up and made breakfast and then the power went out. We ate breakfast and then found the breaker box and flipped the breakers. The lights came back on. We thought everything was good after that but then we went to wash the dishes from our breakfast and the water wasn’t working. We contacted the company, bought a few gallons of water so that we could flush the toilets, and then went to the beach. The beach is not a short path away. It is a rather long road down several streets. We kept asking people we passed where the path was and they laughed and said we were better off driving. When we came back from the beach we started to make lunch and realized that even though the lights were on, the oven hadn’t come back on. So we went out to lunch. When we came back from lunch we put the babies down for a nap. We adjusted the heaters in the rooms and found out that the heaters weren’t working (neither the cadets in the wall or the ductless system that was lighting up like it was on but no air was coming out). We really wanted to stay and did enjoy our first night there, but we couldn’t figure out why the water, oven and heaters weren’t working. At that point we decided to end our trip early and go home to make sure it was safe for our babies who we were worried about getting too cold without heat. After we packed everything up, my husband checked that the door was locked and the door handle came off.

disappointing customer service and not clean
----
We had issue after issue with the unit and the customer service. Unit was dirty. We had to clean it. Used soap left behind on shower, wine stained carpet, holes in carpet, gum stuck to side of master bed night stand, stepped on a screw left behind, dirty socks and paper behind couch. Tvs stopped working after power outage and breaker had to be flipped to get spare bedroom power functioning. No biggie there but then cable boxes had to be replaced..since they werent functional then a few days later the tv in the master stopped displaying video so maintenance had to replace it. Towel service takes all day/night and they dont give you enough for the number of guests. For a family of 5 we got 4. When we asked for more it was an issue for them. They’ll say they will send it right over but you just need to be prepared it isnt timely and set your expectations for that. We ended up just washing our pool and shower towels. One front desk person was especially unkind. Housekeeping came to measure the curtains in all rooms unannounced the day before we checked out… they could have waited a day instead of interrupting our lunch. Pool was closed after big storm as well. That was understandable. But on top of all the fees paid through vrbo (hundreds and hundreds) there is another resort fee you pay. Id like some of these refunded for all the hassle. I have a list of all issues, days, number of calls, etc.

This was the second time we stayed in this unit. We were there last year also. The weather did not permit us to use the pool area. Pros: Owner always responded quickly to anything we needed. There had been a power outage and we could not get reception for tv's. He did everything he could to help us and the problem was resolved. The new refrigerator with an ice maker was a welcome addition. Bedding is very nice and so is furniture. The back patio has a beautiful view of the Catalina Foothills and is a very quiet area. It is also very close to restaurants and grocery stores. The spare bedroom was nice and so is the second bathroom. Cons: We did notice some areas that could use some attention from last year. The kitchen ware is very nice but there is only a setting of four for dishes and utensils. This could be a problem if you have a larger group. The area rug in living room needs cleaned but overall the condo is very clean.

Nous connaissions déjà l’endroit et y retournions avec certaines attentes, mais pas trop élevées à cause d’Irma. Le condo adjacent au nôtre était en rénovation. Pendant 4 des 10 jours de notre séjour, nous avons subi le bruit de démolition de béton, sans aucun préavis avant et durant notre séjour.

We already knew the place and returned there with certain expectations, but not too high because of Irma. The condo adjacent to ours was renovated. For 4 of the 10 days of our stay, we suffered the sound of concrete demolition, without any notice before and during our stay. There was also a power outage and two running outstanding water. The fact remains that the site is magnificent and the island, heavenly.

should say sleeps 10 not 12, rude property managers, overpriced
----
The pullout couch bed option is not really an option. It was a horribly uncomfortable contraption… could not sleep through night on it. They also did not leave spare sheets even though we emailed about it before hand.

The power went out upstairs after the first day and the property managers could not tell me where the breakers were. The outlets were randomly going out as well.

The listing should say that it only sleeps 10. It’s pretty outdated and dirty. The experience was not great.

The only good thing was the location. But it should be priced significantly less for everything else.

check in process… the address given to you is not of this unit and you had to text the owner for checking in as it was never provided. the whole process is strange as he gives you the address and tells you to bypass management, to a location of a hidden key (he will send you a video) and that key is not secured in any way… anyone has access to it or can find it. You then get the keys of the unit which are tracked meaning you are tracked by a Tile.

Unit over all is nice, def not meant for the number of people indicated you will trip over each other with all the cots and no room to walk! It is not a three bedroom unit, but two with a murphy bed in the living space tucked in the corner. 
Rules are listed everywhere as if you are all ready going to break something…. Do not expect any amenities…Decor is nice. 

The building is all short term rental so be prepared for drunken people knocking on doors.

Overall we had a great experience at this location. Upon arrival the place was clean and welcoming. The location is great for all things in the Arenal region (Mistico, Rio Celeste, Hot Springs, etc). The experience of waking up to the sounds of rain, listening to Howler Monkeys and seeing Toucans at this property were absolutely amazing. The only issues we had were the check in/out process. We had to plan a time to meet with the property manager to obtain the keys/fob to get into the gated community and then we had to plan a time to leave. The communication behind this was tough as using USA cell phones in this area is almost non existent due to cell coverage. We also lost power for about an hour the day of check out and had to find a neighbor to help us get it back on. Overall it is an absolutely lovely place and the host does a great job of suppling a good amount of information about the area with their website/app. Highly recommend for families, just make sure to have prior communication with property manager about check-in/out process.

The property would be improved by replacing the filthy carpet with tile or laminate, sharpening the very dull kitchen knives and communicating with the guests about important things like how to get pool towels, how to get clean bath towels, etc. The bedroom would be improved with a night table on both sides of the bed and by replacing the hanging rod in half of the closet with shelves. The bathroom needs more storage and a big walk in shower would be better than a bath/shower combo. Also, the balcony needs a sun shade so that it can be used throughout the day. Considering the volume of citrus fruit in the area, a citrus squeezer in the kitchen would be useful. We enjoyed the nearby hot tub during the cool evenings.

I’ll start with the good.. The location is absolutely perfect! So many restaurants, great area to walk around, Oasis pool is great for kids and adults. The house was a good size and easily accommodated groups 6-12 comfortable with plenty of bathrooms and beds. Now for the not so good.. the house was dirty! Walls look like they’ve never been cleaned, hair and dust on the floors and don’t me started on the carpets, GROSS. Having little kids with us I was constantly on edge as to what they put in their mouths and touched. Oh and also the pool was disgusting!! Upon calling about the pool being heated they said they never received the request and it would take 18 hours when we sent the request back in October. Okay fine, maybe it was overlooked not a big deal since the clubhouse pool was so nice and close by. But, the worst communication came when they sent me an email prior to arrival that all guests were added to our stay, we’ll Ofcourse they were not and everyone except myself got stuck at the gate waiting for me to get ahold of someone during non business hours (I finally got an answer after my 16th call to them). This property just added a lot of stress to what should have been a relaxing vacation stay. I have stayed at so many VRBOS & Air BNBs over the years and have never had an issue. Anyways, don’t let my experience sway you from coming to this property… a little better customer service along with a new cleaning company could make your stay great!

questionable cleanliness and maintenance

There were a few issues with the rental:
1. The hot tub was obviously dirty. It was unusable.
2. The shower handle was completely broken off. 
3. While a minor issue the snow shovel was broken and unusable. Since it had snowed a few feet prior to our arrival it would have been required had we not brought our own.
4. One the guests complained the sheets on his bed smelled like smoke and had to wash them. 

My consternation stems from the obvious nature of these problems. The hot tub was obviously dirty with slim, emitted an oder, low on water, and dirty filter. The shower handle was in pieces on the bathroom counter. The snow shovel was broken and leaning against the sliding door.

While these issues were extremely inconvenient, I commend the management company's response. The issues were addressed on next and following day.

Easy check in.
Pool was super dirty. None of the outside stuff worked-patio fridge/ice maker. The umbrella shown in the photos wasn’t there because of previous renters, that wasn’t communicated so after we asked they dropped off one from Walmart. Patio furniture beat up, cushions for patio furniture was all ripped, stuff hanging out and needs to be replaced. No cleaning products or laundry soap on site as the listing reads. No S&P or seasonings, no garbage bags, no full size dinner plates. No mixing/salad bowls. No hot water in the main shower with the tub. No filter in fridge water. All the cheap kitchen pans, burn your food and leave a bad taste on them. The gas stove oven, doesn’t work properly (over an hr for a cheap 20 min pizza to cook and still wasn’t done) along with a terrible gas smell. We had to buy a broom just to clean a little. The kitchen sink leaks. No pool lights as shown. The beds weren’t great. The towels weren’t plush-they’re cheap. Bathrooms were dirty, no conditioner-and it does state shampoo and soap, but that’s it. Closet doors missing in rooms. I could go on and on. I’m not a rich, bougie person. I camp and don’t mind working with very little, but this place isn’t what is sold to you. It’s very cheaply put together with bare minimum, mismatched thrown together stuff, sold as something far different… I’ve stayed in a lot of places, I wouldn’t stay here again, especially for the money. Very disappointed we flew in from across the country for that. Sucks to work hard for a family vacation, have your hopes up and be so swiftly let down. 
Now, I will say, after we contacted them, they did have them come out right away and clean the pool some, and as I stated, they dropped off a Walmart umbrella. So that was nice. But there just isn’t any effort or extras and it definitely shows. They’re making bank and not putting in anything to make the stay nice for guests from out of state.

great house, poor management

The space and location were great. Plenty of bedrooms, and a few different communal spots to hangout in, which worked well for us.

The kitchens were stocked with the bare minimum, and there was a lack of cleaning supplies and towels.

The hot tub was disgusting when we got there. Completely unusable. I asked them to come clean it or tell us how to clean it ourselves, and they finally did on the afternoon of our last night there. That meant we were only able to use it 1 out of the 3 nights.

The checkout was at 10am, and we were running slightly late. I understand that the expectation was for us to be out by 10, but when the owner arrived, she immediately started berating, threatening, and yelling at us. It was completely unacceptable behavior, and I hope to never be treated that way again.

On our way out the door she told me that she would ""come after us"" so I assume her response to this review will be her attempt at that.

A house with great bones but owner needs to spend a lot of money to fix this house and make it safe for all guests. We loved the Coal coast and will definitely be returning to the area. It was relaxing, beaches great, fantastic walks and uncrowded. Sadly the property is rundown and the pool and deck were unsafe. Rusting steel and unstable decking around pool, dirty stained walls and broken rust in bottom of pool meant we were unable to use the pool at all. Our grandsons were devastated. Deck is also in need of urgent repairs with rotten boards and protruding nails. Outdoor cushions were wet , mouldy and filthy. Internally you could see they had started to work on improving the property but there is still a long way to go. For a $420 cleaning fee I would recommend cleaning windows, laundry sink and cupboard underneath and removing garbage stored in stables. We needed to buy plugs for kitchen sink, squeegee for bathroom floors, water glasses, cling wrap, foil.., Agent did come out to assist when we had problems with lights as they have quirks. We wish the agent well as he is trying to fix problems but it will take owner stepping up. Coal coast is a wonderful holiday destination I would recommend and this is a property that we would love to buy and give it the love and attention it deserves.

Pelican Peak is a beautiful property with amazing views, a nice open floor plan, and a number of extras we really appreciated (beach towels, beach chairs and beach bags). We went here really expecting a ""5"" experience, but were disappointed on several fronts. Issues included the following: 1. No hot water in the guest house for two days (discovered the on/off switch for the water heater was wired backwards and ""on"" meant the hot water heater was off); 2. Pool was not clean. Upon arrival (Wednesday) we saw the pool hadn't been cleaned in a while. On Thursday the property manager told us it would be cleaned Friday. Friday afternoon she asked us if it had been cleaned, and we said ""no"", so she said she'd get back to us. We never heard back from her after that, and the pool still hadn't been cleaned when we left the next Thursday. 3. Pool was cold. Listing does not indicate that the pool is heated, so no issue there, but the cold temp (about 70 degrees F?) was disappointing. 4. The king bed mattress in the guest house was so soft both my wife and I ended up with sore backs after 3 or 4 nights. 5. Both shower drains in the guest house backed up. The indoor shower drain backed up because it was totally covered in hair (really gross), and the outdoor shower appeared to have some type of pipe blockage. Again, this

unit was amazing…property not so much
----
This unit was amazing. It is spotless, beautifully decorated, furnished with everything you could possibly need and in a nice location. The condo was a perfect size for 4 adults. The slight ocean view was a sliver above the palms trees but the mountain view was beautiful. Dining on the patio was a nice option. The screens were restricted from use and mosquitoes were coming in so we had to be sure to close the doors at night
That being said, the building itself and property were a bit of a let down. The check in process was confusing. The valet informed us that the elevator on our side of the building was not operational (it never was fixed all week) so we needed to use the fire stairs which we did to avoid an extremely long walk to another elevator. The cranes erected across from our building were an obstruction to the view and work started every morning at 8. The pools were on the murky side and not very desirable for swimming. The amount of people reserving pool chairs with their belongings made finding a chair to use next to impossible. Signs warn that this isn’t allowed but I never saw any enforcement. The store on the first floor had a lot of items but the freezer was also broken all week so items like pizzas, ice cream and other frozen products were unavailable. Parking in the garage was almost always full after 6 pm (according to valet) so we opted to park in an open lot that was a short walk to our building. The towel lending process of scanning towels in and out worked fine. The food served around the property from Dukes was a plus. The staff at the recreational rental booth was great. When a group of 10 or more staying a few units down began smoking continuously on their balcony each day we informed the valet who said she would notify security and that was quickly rectified. We truly felt that the unit was way nicer than the building and the property. I would assume this is hard for the owner of the unit who may have little or no control over the general running of the building. Don’t go expecting a resort. This is a very beautiful condo in an ok building. It appears that the cranes will be around for a while since they are painting all of the balconies and buildings exteriors. It will look great when it’s done but if we had known in advance we would have chosen a different unit to avoid this. Luggage carts are available but only for use by bellman who were not available so be prepared to handle bags yourself.

four senior couples from canada stayed at villamikanos for 8 days.
----
Pros: 
A beautiful house with ample space for eating together and lounging around the pool. We really appreciated the very large ensuite bathrooms in every room, as well as one in the main area. Great pool. Stunning views of whales, sunrises, and sunsets! 

Cons:
The surrounding neighborhood has a number of derelict buildings and has a run down feeling.

On arrival, the pool was full of green slime. However, it was cleaned by the next day.
The kitchen is very outdated, small and in disrepair. It is quite grimy and there are ants everywhere. Microwave not functioning properly. The fridge shelf fell off and broke when the door was opened. Although the fridge is old, the owner expected we would pay for the entire cost of a new shelf. We settled for paying 50%.

We had arranged with Ana-Laura to have some dinners prepared for us by a local couple. The arrangement was that we would pay them 700 pesos plus costs for groceries. Unfortunately they would never give us receipts and grossly overcharged us… the groceries would have cost less than ⅓ what they asked for. Ana-Laura didn’t seem to care or attempt to make amends.

There was no hot water in two of the four bathrooms during the whole length of our stay as one of the two propane tanks was empty. So half of our group never had hot water.

The pillows were very uncomfortable. This accommodation is in great need of updating and thorough cleaning. One expects a certain level when paying such a high price per night.

Management hasn't made good use of outrageous cleaning charge. Grunge on doors, 1/4 in dust on baseboard, and all about apartment. Dusty. Deck chairs, table covered in fauna debris and bird poop. No mention pool possibly being 65°. Hot tub murky, held hostage by a family of 15 with very small children until 10PM. Topper. . the bathroom code at the pool DID NOT work for several of us guests. Was reported 2X's, no resolution. Where did everyone potty? They did have adequate staff to tag my car morning after arrival, before 8AM with a parking violation. We arrived after hours and entered car before office was open. We decided to refuse parking option at $20 per day and parked on street. This is a precarious situation. I was forced to pay in full 2 months before our arrival. Our credit card company allows us 30 days to dispute. Coconut Condos must have learned from previous unsatisfied guests how to make it work for them. It did not work for us. The Maui Facebook page does offer many helpful accommodation suggestions.

Booked this property for a 3 night stay. On arrival was met by the ""property manager"". As we walked in we were overwhelmed by the smell of mold throughout the house. The manager started showing the property and immediatley began making excuses for the mold, the missing door in the bathrrom, the broken and moldy floor tiles, broken and moldy tub/shower. Paint chipping all around, rotted out door sills. The pool was dirty and looked like it had not been cleaned in weeks. Outdoor furniture was dirty. The manager agreed the property was not in good condition and kept say they were trying to take care of it. This property should be flagged by VRBo as not an acceptable rental. The only positive was that after contacting the owner he issued a full refund. However, this trip cost us $1,000 additional as we had to book a last minute hotel in prime season. Anyone looking in West Palm should steer away from this property.

Things seemed a little off when we first pulled in; there was glass in the driveway and the building reeked of marijuana. There are no rugs to prevent the spread of mud/water from the hot tub. There is only one spoon, fork and knife. There are no dish towels. The hot tub needed to be topped up which lowered the temp to around 92. Two thin pillows and a mattress that will limit your sleep to 15 minute bursts all night. One of the two dining chairs is one bad sit away falling apart. The hot tub water was also very dirty, lots of random fuzz floating around. But most importantly, there was little shards of broken in glass in the hot tub which led to my girlfriend having a bloody toe. 

On the bright side, there is a TV at a watchable angle, a selection of DVDs, checkers and Yahtzee.

Not worth the price tag this cabin demands. I would have expected this experience from a cabin a quarter of the price.

When we arrived the house had not been thoroughly cleaned. There were also broken window panes, cracked tiles, warped floors, peeling paint, etc. We did not have water in one of the bathrooms, one shower did not work properly and we had some electrical issues as well as a dirty pool. In short, the house did not appear as nice as it did in the listing. The first 24 hours were pretty much a disaster since we were on the phone with the property management team and VRBO all evening as well as hosting a maintenance man, cleaning crew and plumber that evening and the next day. Not a great start to our week! We were disappointed to say the least. Once the repairs were made, the week improved. Aruba is beautiful and we enjoyed the island immensely. The house was a good size for our needs (8 adults) but definitely needs some serious TLC and the rental rate should be adjusted accordingly. It is listed as 5 beds/4 baths but the 4th bath is really tiny and poorly constructed which does not allow the water to drain well. This was the most expensive rental we've booked through VRBO and the least nice accommodations.

Well it was clean inside. The outside is over grown with weeds and garbage piled up on the side of the house. I picked this one because I wanted to have a pool and a hot tub. Well hot tub was empty, so I called and they said to fill it with garden hose, and it heats pretty fast. I did and then it took two days to heat up. I asked what was wrong and they sent me directions, and I googled how to fix it as well. So I got to use it once. And the pool was lil too dirty for me. The pool people walked into back yard 2x without warning as I was laying out. The fridge/freezer was leaking on the ground. So all in all I won’t stay there again.

I rented this place for 4 nights for myself and family. What a mistake it was. We reached to this house around 2am. Rental itself looked ok from the outside. Surround it though was very questionable. Didn’t look like a good area. We walked in the place. I was checking things out when I heard my 4 year old screaming. He fell from the stairs going downstairs in the basement. There is a 5in wooden platform at the bottom of the stairs. Which is ridiculous. My son hit his head on the wall and scraped up his leg and arm. The stairs didn’t even have a railing. When I called the owner (host) and informed them what happened. They basically said sorry and fuck off. We left immediately after only checking the house for 5mins. Vrbo was no help either on our complain or money. My daughter also slipped on the same stairs. But luckily she didn’t get hurt. I also stepped on black ice rushing my injured son to the car. The snow and ice was not cleaned. Owner (host) kept our $800 when we didn’t stay there at all.

To Whom It May Concern: 
A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.

Jacques, le gérant, est accessible et répond bien aux questions. Merci! Appartement très bien conçu pour 9 personnes. Chacun a son espace. Bien équipé, par contre une cafetière filtre serait plus adaptée qu'une nespresso compte-tenu de la capacité de l'appartement (10 personnes). Au calme en étant proche du centre et du départ ski, par contre pas de départ et retour skis aux pieds (hors piste). Cependant, l'escalier extérieur mériterait d'être refait, peut être dangereux actuellement.

Jacques, the manager, is accessible and answers questions well. THANKS! Apartment very well designed for 9 people. Everyone has their space. Well equipped, on the other hand a filter coffee maker would be more suitable than a nespresso given the capacity of the apartment (10 people). Quiet by being close to the center and the ski departure, on the other hand no departure and return skis on the feet (off track). However, the external staircase deserves to be redone, can be dangerous today.

Expected a few steps but not both inside and outside condo. Outside stairs were good compared to narrow interior stairwell that felt dark and lower level area small windows and bathrooms. Deck was long but narrow with very uncomfortable high top table and chairs. Difficult to sit and enjoy ocean views. Bedding, pillows and towels very low quality and should be upgraded. Upper level is pretty nice and comfortable. Electronic door locks made strange noise every half hour through out the day and night causing sleep interruptions. Water was shut off 4 hours for repairs. We have stayed in several rentals but this one was strange and would not recommend.

We did like this property very much! The view from the lanai area was great & so loved hearing the sound of the ocean when we slept. All was good in kitchen except 1 fry pan(medium sized) had a bit of rust?/grease? on it. Towels were awesome for size and we found entry to place easy access for us! Elevator close @ hand good & quiet neighbors. The only issue we had was the stairs as both of fell even though we had treads on our flip flops. There was an instant light that alerted us to steps but this was our 1st time in a condo where we should have more diligent in where we were walking. Loved the drawers for storage!
Didn't know bbq was charcoal only, maybe we didn't read that part of the guide book.
We were glad to be in the area.

1.Problems with check in. Locks didn't work, help was a call center in India and took over 30 minutes to get access to the house and they wanted me to troubleshoot their dead battery in the lock..
2. Issues with gate pass, had to get a pass daily from guard instead Ed of getting a pass for our entire stay.
3. No welcome kit with access to resort amenities. The ad said we would have access to resort amenities but after a very long and confusing text exchange with AvantStay we were told, nope, no access to amenities. They suggested that we just go to the amenities center and see if we could get in-like jump the fence.
4. House smelled bad.
5. Lied on advertising- no access to resort amenities, no outdoor dining, no deck, no outdoor living space.
6. Hidden fees and surprise charges after hitting book.
7. WiFi was so slow, we didn't use it.
8. Furniture was uncomfortable/unusable except for the beds. 
9. Garage doors didn't open.
10. Banister caps all loose and falling off safety hazard.
11. No resort information.
12. I spent entirely too much of my time texting with AvantStay instead of enjoying my family.

Stayed with our family of 4 and my parents for a weekend away. Plenty of room for everyone. Location is 15-20 minutes to most stores/restaurants. Upon arrival, there was 4 inches of snow in the driveway and unshoveled steps, making it very slippery. Behind the couch there was a dead mouse in a trap that looked like it had been there for some time. Bugs- dead and alive- throughout the house. I realize it’s a country home but it seemed like no one had actually been at the house for some time. WiFi didn’t work. Property management was very quick to respond to all questions. Check in/check out process was very easy. I loved that there wasn’t a long list of chores to do before we left. like most rentals! Kitchen had everything we needed to make a big meal. Plenty of towels. Beds/bedding very comfortable. It was not the worst Vrbo experience, but I wouldn’t stay again.

good experience overall!
----
The property was absolutely beautiful, and location was quite perfect! Not close to other cabins, nice view, and the house had everything we needed inside. The kitchen was perfectly stocked, above and beyond what is typically provided (still bring some extra paper towels, trash bags, and dishwasher pods with you, just in case). Beds and rooms were comfortable; both levels in the house have their own thermostats for comfortable temperature settings. Great natural light everywhere, and functional window coverings for privacy, in spite of large windows everywhere. We also really enjoyed the firepit - just remember to bring your own firewood, as it is not provided.

The only negative sides of the stay had to do with the quality of the construction. There doesn't appear to be any sound insulation between the two floors; it is extremely noisy downstairs when anyone as little as gets out of bed or walks across the room upstairs.

There is hardly any water pressure, if more than one faucet is used at the same time. With four full bathrooms in the house, this was an issue while trying to get ready in the AM, or cleaning up after hikes and activities.

There was a leak from an upstairs bathroom that was coming out on the stair steps; not a huge leak, but big enough to make those steps slippery and unsafe, if we didn't catch it.

There were several very large pieces of siding that came detached from the roof of the patio, and were hanging down very low, looking like they could fall off on our heads any minute. Made a large portion of the upstairs patio unusable during our stay. and we didn't really have a safe way to walk to the outdoor patio fireplace we wanted to use.

Last, but not least - don't attempt getting there in a low-rider small car that is weighted down with people and luggage. The road is very windy and steep, and there is a big gravel/dirt hump in the middle, which would have made things difficult for a lower smaller car.

Overall, good experience, and I am sure the property management will address the ""maintenance"" issues above (they were already beginning work on them when we called them in). If you're ok with ear plugs for the lack of sound insulation, and don't mind low water pressure, AND you drive at least a higher sedan or a crossover - this is a wonderful place for the whole family to enjoy! We will consider going back ourselves.

The house was as described. Nice common area, great for sledding out back.

beautiful home, but one little issue...
----
Myself, my now husband, mother, grandparents, and my best friend stayed here for my wedding. We were looking for a house with direct beach access as we were getting married on the beach and figured that would be easier than getting ready and having to drive somewhere else for the ceremony. The house IS beautiful with breathtaking views. It is very spacious. There are a lot of steps though. There is a whole bathroom and a suite with a king bed and en suite bathroom on the top floor along with a living room and kitchen. We put my grandparents in that bedroom so they didn't have to use the stairs except to leave.

The boardwalk and porch stairs can be slippery when wet so be careful in the morning and when it rains. The kitchen is well stocked so cooking is easy (except lack of dish towels). Definitely bring your own paper towels and toilet paper as the stuff they leave for you are terrible. Also bring extra blankets and towels. They do have some beach chairs and umbrellas!

The only reason I docked a star is because of the hot water. I guess the property hadn't been used in a while so the hot water smelled like rotten eggs. Badly. The smell filled the entire house. I called the office our first night there because if we were going to need a different property I wanted to deal with it night one so we could focus on the wedding. Someone from the office called about an hour and a half later, instructed us to just run the water and see if the smell goes away. We did exactly that in every faucet and shower. The smell did go away, but it filled the entire house. We had left to go to Night of Lights, dinner, and ice cream. The smell was so strong we could smell it even outside when we returned several hours later. It would be nice if the company would take care of this before someone arrives if the property has been sitting empty, especially for the cost. I'm glad it worked out well so we didn't have to scramble for a new stay while dealing with wedding stuff as well.

All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The house is beautiful and mostly worth it. If you have people with you with mobility issues, it may not work out or put them on the top floor to minimize going up and down. I would also encourage you to contact the rental company to inquire about anyone staying there and see if they can help you with the stench of the water. For the price and the fact it's vacation, renters shouldn't be left to deal with such a disgusting, pungent smell.

Les positifs vue superbe, poêle à bois réconfortant chalet atypiques hygiène correcte. 
Le chalet est sur trois nivaux 3 chambres en bas sejour cuisine 1 er et deuxièmes grand dortoir. 
 Le point negatif du sejour le chalet est situé a 200 m dune piste bleu qui n'a pas été ouverte du sejour . Mal organisons des navettes avec tres peu d'horaires et ne fonctionnaient que pour monter ( descendaient vide aller comprendre ) avec trois enfants en bas ages 😮‍💨 . Le tord reviens à la station et le propriétaire en subit les conséquences car le locataire en retient pas un bon souvenir. 
A amélioré la sécurité des deux escaliers dangereux pour les enfants . Table de sejour petite pour 12 .

Positives superb view, comforting wood stove atypical chalet correct hygiene.
The chalet is on three nivaux 3 bedrooms below staying 1st and second large dormitory.
The negative point of the stay The chalet is located 200 m from a blue track which was not open from the stay. Mal organize shuttles with very few schedules and only worked to go up (descended empty to understand) with three children below ages 😮‍💨. The Tord returns to the station and the owner undergoes the consequences because the tenant does not retain a good memory.
Improved the safety of the two staircases dangerous for children. Small stay table for 12.

The property is so charming and has everything you need for a cozy and comfortable stay. Despite other reviews, we did not find the stairs from car to front door to be an issue. However once inside there are 2 flights of harrowing stairs that are not safe for a young child without close watch. The home is not ideal if you have a young child especially if not traveling w baby gates. We managed and did fine, but the worrying kept mama up at night. :) The loft area is also not accessible for young children which was a pity as it looked super cute! Aside from stairs, we enjoyed our stay very much. The property is clean, cozy, well stocked and convenient to downtown Stowe. The sauna is a blissful touch! The property managers are incredibly responsive and friendly and helped us quickly navigate a few things to settle in. We would definitely go back, but recommend the owners update the listing regarding the internal staircases for other potential renters w infants/toddlers.

beautiful house with ocean views and walking distance to everything

Seth and his amazing rental managers were super easy to work with and very responsive in helping us with everything from finding a driver to a rental cart to how to open the door. Just a short walk to any food you could want and the beach, it’s centrally located. The hill is a beast, but a good way to get in a short workout. Older folks or anyone with knee or hip problems will require a golf cart to access the property up and down. Lots of stairs to get in also, so if you have elders or injured, maybe hard, but worth it for the views this place provides. If your a night owl, good for you, because between 11pm-4am every night every dance club in town pumps their music as loud as possible and there is no avoiding it. Bring earplugs! If your an early bird, just down the hill, a 1 minute walk is the amazing yah-yah cafe. Would I come back, to this house, absolutely, but with better earplugs. Great overall experience. Kitchen had all of the basics and more, beach towels provided.

It's a nice little place with plenty of space. The apartment is located near the beach in a nice little neighborhood close to a wonderful coffee shop and corner market. I appreciated the garage space to park my car.
Unit was clean and all instructions for check-in and check-out were easy. Plenty of things to do within walking distance.

Starting with the positives: Excellent location, great lanai and backyard. The property manager was extremely responsive to the issues that needed immediate attention—AC was broken and kitchen sink stopped up/disposal not working when we got there. Those were all fixed within days and we were refunded for the first 4 days. The internet was good— except that when the neighbor’s pool filter switches on the power goes off for a few seconds and the router has to be reset. The house decor needs some updating—a couple $1000 on sprucing up the place would make a world of difference. Bedspreads, newer furniture, nicer decorations. Poor front door lighting makes it hard to see the keypad and the steps a tripping hazard. It’s not really equipped for staying for a month— kitchen is tiny and basic so daily cooking was difficult. All in all, We had a great month of beautiful weather and the house was very dog friendly, so still worthwhile !

We thoroughly enjoyed our two week stay. We went into Savannah, Fort Pulaski, Hilton Head. We rented a golf cart and tooled around the island, great fun. It is only 4 block walk to the beach but I was recovering from a broken leg. We ate several places but we ate twice at AJ’s, North Bar and Hucapoos. The house was great, we loved it, our puppies loved the fenced in yard. We would highly recommend this house.

large house with outstanding views

This house was great for our family and friends, with plenty of room to spread out. The views from the deck are phenomenal! The kitchen and bathrooms were well stocked. The owner and host were both great to work with! There are a few things that should be done to the property to make it 5 stars. There was no way to secure the house. The side door was swelled and could not be closed and locked. The house is remote enough that we did not worry about it too much. The wifi did not work if you got very far away from the modem. You could not use it at all outside or in the downstairs bedrooms. A few inexpensive wifi extenders would do the trick. The house is showing some age and is in need of some maintenance. Small thing but they add up. The deck is showing age with rusted screws and sections of the flooring are rotting. The walk around outside to the downstairs bedroom needs to be repaired as the hand wire to hold onto is broken. The microwave display did not work, so you had to guess on the setting. Old junk sitting outside behind the lower deck. Just a bunch of those types of things being taken care of would easily bump this to a five-star home. Overall we loved it though!

getaway gone wrong!

This was a trip for my daughters birthday. We were excited from the photos online. Check in was easy and we were able to enter earlier. Once inside there was a musty stale stuffy odor as if the place had not been open for a long time. Surfaces, drapes bedrooms were very dusty. We immediately went to purchase cleaning supplies. No matter what we sprayed it still had a stale musty odor in the home. The vents were very dusty and you can see the dust hanging out the vents. My kids have really bad allergies so they doubled up on their medicine. The ceiling has many spots where it looked like water leaked and had stains. We stayed out as much as possible and only came in to sleep. On our final night we went to bed early since we had to wake for a flight early that morning. We were awoken around midnight by the kids saying there was flooding from upstairs. There was so much anxiety surrounding this we were trying to get the master toilet to stop leaking and called the owners. We couldn't even go back to bed. My daughter slipped and fell with all the water downstairs trying to stop the water from spreading further. The owners seemed sincere on the phone, but refused to do anything for the troubles. It seemed as if this was something they were aware of but chose not to fix it. We loved the area, but this was not a good experience for us.

an adequate stay at the guest house

My mom and I had an adequate stay at the guest house. We were traveling to oversee some construction in a near by neighborhood. Rosy, our host, was very communicative. And the house adjacent guest house is accurately depicted in the listing. Check-in was smooth, however, when we first arrived we noted that the unit smelled very strongly of perfumed, synthetic, cleaning supplies. This was a huge disappointment. We think it was used on hard surfaces so the bedrooms seemed relatively ""safe"" from the smell. We wound up eating our first dinner in the bedroom. This was really disappointing! This is an expensive listing and it felt like corners were cut, i.e.: cheap cleaning supplies, opened coffee beans, Irish spring hand soap. I use the word ""adequate"" because that was our experience. I'm somewhat surprised by the all 5-star reviews. This accommodation met our needs, that was it. Also we could hear sound travel between the unit and the main house (+ dog barking). The property itself was beautiful and we appreciated the view; easy access to Topanga Canyon is also lovely and valuable to us. I would imagine the swimming pool is quite nice, though we didn't get a chance to experience it in February (off season). The appliances worked (note: no stove top, induction style ""hot plate""). I was grateful for the heating unit in the living room as we needed it and the space heaters in the bedrooms. The windows in my bedroom didn't open (disappointing); shower-head is low-flow.

We sadly didn't see any moose like other guests did, but definitely saw their tracks. Beautiful morning sunrises can be seen from many places inside and outside the home. The front deck is likely primo in the summer and fall.

We had booked this place 2-3 months prior to our 8 day trip to Curacao. 3 days prior to leaving, got a message that the place was not available. Feeling put in a difficult situation, and while another location was offered (didn't have a kitchen with cooking facilities), the manager/owner relented and gave us the room as originally booked. 

We were greeted by hostess upon our arrival and our departure - explained things to us. Gated community, clean inside and out, pool was fine. Bed was a little stiff. Had to call to get some extra pots and knives to actually cut with - got some hand-me-down replacements. No toaster no coffee maker. Gentleman-host was responsive, but seemed like he was having to play catch-up. 

The bathroom toilet leaked water onto the floor everytime it was flushed. It wasn't set properly and someone had been trying to fix with silicone without success. Had to mop the floor with bleach and water to kill the icky-ness and try and the smell.

Weekend guests in adjacent units arrived the night before we had to leave and for some reason were rearranging the furniture above us on the patio at 1am.

Just felt like it was someone's investment property and we were the cash flow. Spend the bare minimum in upkeep, get em in, get em out.

We were greeted by a sliding screen door that was broken and made entry and exit a challenge.
The TV did not work and continuously showed a “No Signal” message. The biggest problem was the broken pullout sofa. My wife seriously injured her finger trying to fold the pullout to sofa mode. The sofa was broken and could not be stowed properly - no matter what we did. We notified the owner immediately. It took two full days to address the broken sofa. During that two day period the sofa could not be used for sitting or sleeping. We returned back after being out for the day and the sofa was folded back in place, but clearly still broken. We received NO message from the owner as to what the issue was or whether or not we could use the sofa safely. And the owner never inquired about my wives injured finger. On a lesser note, there were three interior lights that were not operational (probably just needed bulb replacement). The key to the front door or the lock needs repair as it was difficult to unlock. I plan to send photos of the broken sofa mechanism and my wife’s bloody and injured finger to the owner and Point pleasant Resort management.

perfect cabin tucked away yet somehow close to everything
----
Minutes from Peak 9 and downtown, but also secluded enough to feel like you’re tucked away somewhere deep in the mountains. Sometimes photos make a home look better than it is, this absolutely isn’t the case with Southern Pines (it’s even better in person!)
Other than the fact it’s beautifully decorated, open the cabinets and you’ll find all of the amenities of home (and probably more) sippy cups for toddlers, bath toys, plush robes, and every kitchen item one might need. We sat in the hot tub on the gorgeous deck as snow fell around us and planned our trip back in the summer when we know we’ll be able to hear the Blue River flowing just below us.

perfect cabin tucked away yet somehow close to everything
----
Minutes from Peak 9 and downtown, but also secluded enough to feel like you’re tucked away somewhere deep in the mountains. Sometimes photos make a home look better than it is, this absolutely isn’t the case with Southern Pines (it’s even better in person!)
Other than the fact it’s beautifully decorated, open the cabinets and you’ll find all of the amenities of home (and probably more) sippy cups for toddlers, bath toys, plush robes, and every kitchen item one might need. We sat in the hot tub on the gorgeous deck as snow fell around us and planned our trip back in the summer when we know we’ll be able to hear the Blue River flowing just below us. My only complaint is that any other home rental we’ve booked since staying at Southern pines is just a let down.

outdated & musty
----
Pros:The location of this property was perfect. Right across the street from John’s Pass, and right on the beach. Pool was very nice and can’t beat the view. Washer and dryer on site was nice. Size of the unit was great and liked the layout. 

Cons: This particular unit needs a lot of attention in my opinion. Cabinet door knobs were sticky and grimy, baseboards were filthy, beds were super worn in and uncomfortable, showers had mold in the caulk, and the entire unit smelled of must. There was even some mold around the ceiling vents. The carpeting was stained and worn down. Cosmetically it was outdated…. Furniture was mismatched and didn’t fit the space well. 

One evening when I was getting into bed, I even noticed blood stains on the pillow (not on the pillow case, but on the pillow itself). To be clear, these did not come from me. When I went to swap it out for an extra that was in the closet, all of those were full of stains and what appeared to be mold. 

This unit “got the job done” in terms of a good location and a roof over our heads, but definitely did not meet my expectations of basic cleanliness. Won’t be staying again.

Thank you, the cabin was very well equipped in the kitchen, restrooms, bedrooms, and more. The only recommendation i give is, that if is snowing shared with the guest that they need to remove the snow to be able to park the cars in the drive way. I don't have any experience with this and after you call us with the situation with the neighbors I got very tense. We had to remove the snow and it was very late and very cold. After we removed the snow, we were able to park the cars but it was also very slippery and we did had a very hard time to accommodate the cars. We could have done this earlier during the day and not late at night. The good thing of this experience is that now I know what to do next time that there is snow in the drive way :) . Sorry with the inconvenient we caused with the neighbors, I felt very bad. I do hope to return to this cabin in the future, it was great.

I do a lot of research before committing to a property for vacation. I’ve never had an issue through VRBO. This house had good reviews just stated it needed some updating. When we walked in the house, it immediately smelled musty. EVERY SINGLE VENT HAD BLACK MOLD ALL AROUND IT!!!! I was in tears, what was I supposed to do with my family??? I called the owner who was very prompt to help, but just cleaning the ceiling of the mold DOES NOT take it out of the vents and into the air. Not only was it a health issue, the carpet is disgusting and in major need of cleaning. The toilet seat in master bathroom was cracked and falling apart. The garage/game room is 90 degrees with no ventilation. Oh, not to forget the extra pillows in the closets DID NOT HAVE PILLOWCASES!!!!! They were stained and gross. 

The owner should take the money we just paid and do some major cleaning of this property. The owner was quick to call management and fix the issues, but it is clear he has not been to this property in some time…..

I grew up in this area and still have family that I come to visit, but we have a large family so we needed our own place to stay. This house was great. It’s in a beautiful location, under 8 minutes to town and it’s nice, quiet, and private. We had 2 families with kids that were able to all sleep comfortably in the house and then we were able to entertain some of our other relatives for dinner one night too. There’s plenty of space and it’s open and spread out so the kids could play in their own space as well. Everything was clean and put together. The hot tub was a nice bonus and the adult went in at night and enjoyed the stars and the kids went in during the day to play. Heather, the owner, was great and replied promptly. I needed a pack and play for my littlest and she was able to make sure one was there so I didn’t have to pack mine.

beautiful harbour location

The villa is located in a stunning harbour location, with a beautiful view of yachts coming and going. The beach is a short walk away and also very pleasant. Mosquitoes are a problem and some of the mosquito protection on the windows is broken. Citronella candles, deet and mosquito-killing spray are a must. Transport is also difficult. The local golf buggy rental centre did not have golf buggies available and the car parking space at the villa was so tight, it was almost impossible to park a car in. This leaves you walking to the supermarket in the heat or trying to get a taxi. Would suggest supermarket runs first thing in the morning or after sunset. We had some success using a wheeled suitcase to carry heavy groceries. You do need to buy bottled water for drinking, so you need to solve the shopping issue somehow. We did really enjoy our stay despite the issues, but will probably not return.

Es dreckig, die Schlafzimmer voller Schimmel, Fenster kaputt, alles wollten sie extra bezahlt haben (obwohl zuerst Internet und Klimaanlage drinstand, dann war die Beschreibung etwa einen Tag nicht erreichbar und danach mit weniger Optionen). Auch musste ich nach der Zahlung noch mal mehr bezahlen (ohne Rückerstattungsmöglichkeit). Es war so kalt und feucht, dass wir eine Heizung kaufen mussten. Auf der Kleidung hat sich Schimmel gebildet. Die Kinder sowie ein Erwachsener hatten Atemprobleme. Wir haben für die Nacht die besten Matratzen verwendet, um im Wohnbereich zu schlafen und die Schlafzimmer gemieden. Auch war es ausserhalb von allem (nicht in Olhos de Água sondern in Patã de Baixo und eine Stunde Fussmarsch vom nächsten Strand entfernt). Ach, ich will nicht mehr daran denken ... NICHT ZU EMPFEHLEN!

It is dirty, the bedrooms full of mold, windows broken, they wanted everything to have paid extra (even though the internet and air conditioning are included, the description was not accessible for about a day and then with fewer options). I also had to pay more after payment (without reimbursement option). It was so cold and moist that we had to buy a heater. Schimmel has formed on clothing. The children and an adult had breathing problems. We used the best mattresses for the night to sleep in the living area and avoided the bedrooms. It was also outside of everything (not in Olhos de água but in Patã de Baixo and an hour's walk from the next beach). Oh, I don't want to think about it anymore ... not to be recommended!

some big but avoidable issues
----
The good: First, the house is beautiful and the size was convenient for my family and wedding party to stay for my Chicago wedding. We were able to check in early too, which was great.
The bad: The location is probably pretty dicey if you are a suburbanite but if you live in the city it’s not too bad. There is a food bank and planned parenthood on the corner, some closed stores, the house next door is boarded but I think they are working on it.
The weird: there were no drinking glasses in the house, there were some margarita glasses and coffee cups but nothing for just water. I think there are 7 forks for a house that can hold up to 14 people. The beds all had a fitted sheet and duvet with cover but no top sheet. 
The ugly: when we first got there, Aiste told us that the property manager was out of town for the first two days and the house would likely be cold. We understood and imagined it would be like, maybe 50 degrees at worst, because no one would want their pipes to freeze, etc. It was 32 degrees no joke, we had were shivering and had to leave for a while until it was reasonable to be in the house. Then, when my brother and his pregnant wife arrived, we realized that the downstairs bedroom windows were open and were broken, and incapable of closing. It was -2 degrees that night and the property manager was not available. There were no tools in the house, so we had to go to the hardware store to buy tape and plastic to try to keep my 7 months pregnant sister in law from freezing. Worst was that Aiste knew the windows were broken and knew we were coming (we paid in full 5 months ago), and knew it was winter, but did not have the basement windows fixed in a dangerous neighborhood where there was gun violence so near our house that the police asked us which direction the gun shots came from! And when it was -2 degrees outside. And then, unbelievably, asked us if we could fix it! I have the texts. So I will be contacting VRBO about this because the house was not in safe, working order for us and we had to mitigate it ourselves.

a stay ruined by the property manager joanne
----
I booked this home for a week long stay. A really well appointed, clean townhouse that has an odd smell I could not figure out (mix of musty, moldy, urine, dampness, bad carpet). I notified the property manager Joanne about the smell expecting a solution (you know, cleaning or fragrances) and it's really hard to believe but Joanne's solution was for me to leave! If it sounds crazy, it is. Now you might think I did something wrong or I was rude, or demanding, I didn't. I have the entire transcript, happy to send along if you can find me via email. I asked her for a change of sheets as well, but she only had one set (for the week with no washer) and I informed her the toilets she had serviced still weren't working correctly. That was just too much. I think this is a sufficient property as long as you don't need anything of the property manager/don't mind off smells. This the wildest stay I've ever had. You know how it is with narcissism, criticism isn't handled very well. Long story short, I was evicted after asking about the smell. Also, be warned, next door is a burned out townhouse with broken windows and full of trash from a fire that killed the tenant. A sketchy view from the king bedroom window.

You might be better off staying somewhere on Washington St or in Harpers Ferry. 

Maybe the owners will get a new property manager because this one is losing them money.

When we first arrived at our reserved unit, 703. We were very underwhelmed. The condo was very worn… the carpet was dirty, the window shades were broken, beat up or missing and the whole place smelled very damp and must. It seemed as if it were abandoned for some time. After a long day of travel we were seeking a good nights rest to begin our vacation. However, our daughter woke us up at 2am where we discovered that there was a large portion of her ceiling above the twin beds leaking and dripping on here head. The whole bed was soaked. Needless to say we had a terrible first night. Things were rectified instantly by the property manager the next morning. We were moved to 805, which was pristine and $100 cheaper per night. We were also refunded our first night. After the first hiccup we had an amazing stay. The grounds our gorgeous, the facilities were great and all staff were beyond helpful and friendly. We will return… just being more careful of the condition of our next rental.

Pros: Clean place and not far from town. Great fireplace and views of the mountain. Living room area and kitchen were the best part of the house. Although not much couch space to sit if you are going with a larger groups of people. Management of Stowe country homes was good and very responsive to lack of heat we experienced they sent over HVAC right away to address it. 

Cons: House needs EXTREME updating. I have rented MANY houses and this is by far the worst one and first bad review I have ever left. The upstairs “suite” has a bathroom that looks like it’s from the 70’s, with a terrible size shower and water pressure. It was absolutely FREEZING in the bathroom as well. Advertised as a queen size bed but very I comfortable for my husband and I to both sleep in felt more and looked more like a double. Staying on walls in bathrooms and on doors. Beware if you have small children there’s a window like shutter in the bedroom that you can easily be a hazard as the ledge for it is low. The house I also advertised in the description as a 3 bedroom meanwhile on of the bedrooms has a sofa with a pullout. Old blinds that are yellow in color. Old tile flooring in the 2 bedrooms on the main floor. Cracks on the walls. The basement is completely unfinished with old worn leather couch and old cushion couches. Concrete floor, Would not want to spend anytime hanging out down there in that kind of condition. Overall this house really needs to be updated and furnishing replenished before being rented out. My husband and I really did not sleep well because of the lack of space and comfortability for us to sleep.

If you’re looking for a condo getaway that is within easy walking distance of everything in Waikiki this place is great. The balcony views are awesome! Downside of being in the middle of everything is that it is pretty noisy. But they do have good windows so you can close them and it is quieter. Nice layout and fairly new tile, kitchen cabinets and bathroom finishes.

location and rooftop can't be beat

I’m going to leave an honest review of our experience so you can decide if this property is for you. First, we did not receive the code for entry of the house. I had to call the management company (AMI) when we arrived. Not a great start. Upon entry, we discovered the water was turned off. Although I understand this is probably not a recurring issue with this house, this was unacceptable. The water was off for 24 hours before it was finally restored. AMI handled this issue as quickly as they could.

When we arrived, the handle to the kitchen sink was completely broken off. I fixed it myself. The elevator was not working, so we had to haul every bin and bag we had up the stairs (and you’re talking, like, 20 foot levels).

The pool was “working” but the lights as well as the waterfall jets were not. This needs to be fixed as the lights at night would be nice and probably a bit safer. The listing says the pool is serviced twice a week: not true. Not a single person came to service or clean the pool the entire time we were there and we had to contact the management company three times to get someone to come out and finally look at it. A tech came who had no clue how to fix it BUT they did leave the hose in the pool, blasting water for over four hours before we noticed it was overflowing and finally realizing the hose was running. 

NONE of the TVs worked when we got there. AMI said someone would come out. I figured out what was wrong myself before the tech came many days later. 

VERY unhappy about the $120+tax “damage fee” they charge. Apparently this is non-refundable. If AMI/VRBO charges every guest a damage fee before setting foot on the property, EVERYTHING should be in working order. What am I paying this for, exactly? Stay here at your own risk. There is a guestbook in the living room where everyone signs and tells a little about their stay. We are not the first to have issues here… Although the location of the property is unbeatable and many other aspects of this property are nice, this property has a long history of broken things. (This includes windows that were also still broken when we stayed there) We are not the exception when it comes to these issues.

The good:

The backyard pool area is nice and secluded with excellent landscaping. The rooftop deck has the best views of both the harbor and the ocean. The sunsets are great. All the patios are great. Having beach cruiser bikes in the garage was nice as well.

Good luck!

good but a number of shortcomings
----
We have recently returned from an overnight stay in Stable Cottage along with my sister and brother-in-law. One of the main reasons for choosing the Cottage, given my brother-in-law is disabled, was the fact that there were no steps to be negotiated and the accommodation was all on one floor with each bedroom having an en-suite shower room. However, it was disappointing to discover that there were no grab handles in either shower room, which given that the word “accessible” is used in the description was somewhat puzzling.

We really liked the layout of the accommodation and the property is very inviting and comfortable. Unfortunately, the claim that there was a “fully stocked kitchen” turned out to be woefully untrue. Just by way of establishing some credibility we successfully ran 3 self-catering properties, 2 of which were in France and one in Dorset, for several years.

If we were being unkind then we could assume that the reason for the lack lustre approach to equipping the kitchen was meant to encourage guests to use the restaurant and that the self catering part of the business is a low priority compared with weddings, corporate events, hotel and restaurant.

good but a number of shortcomings
----
We have recently returned from an overnight stay in Stable Cottage along with my sister and brother-in-law. One of the main reasons for choosing the Cottage, given my brother-in-law is disabled, was the fact that there were no steps to be negotiated and the accommodation was all on one floor with each bedroom having an en-suite shower room. However, it was disappointing to discover that there were no grab handles in either shower room, which given that the word “accessible” is used in the description was somewhat puzzling.

We really liked the layout of the accommodation and the property is very inviting and comfortable. Unfortunately, the claim that there was a “fully stocked kitchen” turned out to be woefully untrue. Just by way of establishing some credibility we successfully ran 3 self-catering properties, 2 of which were in France and one in Dorset, for several years. Since all 3 properties had a dishwasher, then as is normal practice we provided double the quantity of crockery, glassware, cutlery etc. This property was supposed to house 6 people but there was not even 6 of everything, let alone 12!

The home was very clean and located well for accessing Minneapolis and St. Paul. On the side of things that need improvement: 
-The bathtubs are both very slippery and definitely need non skin mats. 
-Handyman work could use a professional touch. both bathrooms need caulking and tub drain plugs off
-Its winter and blankets on the beds would have been appropriate
- Horrible kitchen - NOT a kitchen if you plan to cook
 - stove is the worst stove I have ever tried to cook on and I am an old lady. 
 - sink will not hold wash water
 - Silverware and serving utensils are minimal - there are only 3 knives in the silverware drawer
 - very disappointed in the kitchen and supplies.

We booked this after Hurricane Ian devastated Fort Myers Beach, where we have been going the last few years. We took a chance in an unfamiliar area and were so happy we did! Indian Shores is in an ideal location, on a beautiful beach.
This unit is very dated, but met our requirements. The bonus was that the 2nd bedroom was set up as an office, perfect for my husband who works remotely. 
The bed in the master bedroom was very comfortable!
The condo could have been cleaner on check in, but we bought some disinfectant wipes and cleaned ourselves.
Things to improve… there were no beach towels provided, which I found out before we left home; kind of annoying to take valuable weight in my luggage with towels. A scissor in the kitchen would have been helpful and a starter pack of detergent would have been nice. I needed to ask for a non-stick mat for the shower, as the tub was very slippery; it was delivered immediately. 
One of the blankets in the closet was extremely dirty… I asked and received a new, clean one, but they did not take the dirty one away.
Overall, we had a great 2 weeks and would definitely come back to this building, but probably in another unit.

5 STAR PROPERTY is an understatement!
It was exactly as described in the listing and so much more! There is so much to experience on property making it extremely difficult to depart. From the large theater room with surround sound and plush leather recliners to the fully equipped karaoke studio offering online access to all your favorite tunes, this home has it ALL! Whether it's gaming, shooting a game of pool or engaging in a one on one ping pong challenge championship, there's never a shortage of activities and something for everyone! 
And if romance is what you crave... I highly recommend pouring yourself a cocktail at sunset before slipping into the most deliciously positioned and well maintained hot tub! While gazing upon Lake Candlewood, you'll enjoy a front row seat to a stage honoring clear skies and dancing constellations! 
It seems your host, Peter, thought of every meticulous detail making this home a recipe for perfection! 
The kitchen is fully equipped for entertaining and creating a masterful feast, and the outdoor spaces make it nothing short of priceless for family gatherings and reunions! Additionally, the home feels like a 5-Star boutique resort! It's tidy, clean, and well maintained. I myself prioritize a good night's rest while on vacation and I must say, without hesitation that the master suite most certainly offers a such an experience with a king size bed not soon forgotten! And, no worries... food and spirit provisions are only minutes away, and if the detailed instructional guides lack the answers you seek, Peter is a phone call away! 
He was a ""rock star"" host and available when needed. 
I not only highly recommend this property, I want to LIVE THERE! 
Yes ... we will be back...

This is an older park model trailer. It’s nothing fancy, and has several issues, but it is clean and well supplied. 

 The resort is very nice. And the location is close to many places of interest. 

We had some difficulty and confusion at check in. The key is in a lock box that we struggled to get I open Once we did get into it we tried to open the door that the box was hanging from, but it would not open. We then discovered the key fit the sliding door. Small thing, but it was kind of frustrating after a day of travel. Then it became clear that the other door was another room that we did not have access to. Not a big deal, just would have liked to know this before hand. Nice backyard that we did not get to use because we were only there a short time. The small front porch had overgrown vines and dirty chairs. There was rain recently so maybe the host had not had a chance to clean them yet. 

If you’re just needing a place to land at night and don’t need luxury accommodations, this will be fine. It’s not fancy. There’s an unsightly tangle of wires hanging below the television. And using the television was confusing. If you’re cooking you have to step into the hallway in order to get into the refrigerator. The binder with information was just three pages and was not a great help. 

It was just ok.

If you’re just needing a place to land at night and don’t need luxury accommodations, this will be fine. It’s not fancy. There’s an unsightly tangle of wires hanging below the television. And using the television was confusing. If you’re cooking you have to step into the hallway in order to get into the refrigerator. The binder with information was just three pages and was not a great help. 

It was just ok.

I am not interested in streaming replays on Sunday evening of CNN news from last Friday morning, ""used news"" has no value. 
Cable must be a cost these owners don't want to pay, but I will be questioning listings in the future about available live TV.

The good:
1) ease of parking
2) plenty of dishes (though I would have preferred some drinkware that wasn't plastic)
3) there were sufficient towels for the four of us
4) The wifi seemed to work fine as did the oven and stove
5) I appreciated the communication before our arrival with codes, etc for ease-of-check-in. 

The bad: 
1) Fireplace is inoperable (not disclosed)
2) Only loud space heaters
3) Shuttle stop closed despite showing on the Angel Fire map (not disclosed)
4) No storage for clothing or guest groceries
5) Poor condition overall. The chairs had stains, the ceiling was peeling away in the bathroom, and the main bathroom had no cover on the lights and exposed wires. The floors had large gaps between the floorboards, the refrigerator can't open all the way because it's crammed into a corner, and the door in the bathroom hits the toilet every time you try to open it. The bedding on the beds isn't as fresh or clean looking as the photos. There were stains on the bedspread, there was a spider in the water reservoir of the coffee maker (eww!), there were crumbs or lint or something on the living room carpet, and there were dirty dishes in the dishwasher. 
6) The dishwasher reeked of cigarette smoke.

I reached out to Vacasa (mgmt company) multiple times to let them know and received no response or accountability regarding our experience. 
I would not recommend renting from a rental managed by Vacasa or this unit in particular.

good property held back by the little things

Summary: Could be a great property but currently not worth the money.

This property had a lot of positives. The location was nice. Good neighborhood. Garage parking. Full washer and dryer. Wall A/C units. Plenty of space. Great views. Host communicated all requirements clearly and in a timely manner.

It also had some issues. Spiderwebs on just about every ceiling, with spiders. I had to kill and clear one above the master bed before we could sleep. The house gives off an “unfinished” vibe. There are open holes/outlets with wires sticking out. Like there used to be a tv or sound system wired, but it’s a lot of wires. One of the water faucets, the top came off if you pulled on it to turn on the water. All of this added up to a very cheap feeling for the house and I felt not worth the money. I paid $730 NZD/night. 

Also, and this is just more of an oddity, there are so many light switches and either we couldn’t figure them all out or some of them don’t work. Like, more light switches than ever I’ve seen in a house.

Very clean & nicely decorated property. Lots of towels, pillows, & washcloths. Wish I would’ve found the salt & pepper shakers before our last day! Also wish there would have been a bit of olive oil for cooking and a better spatula for frying eggs. Nice to have coffee filters on hand as well as plenty of paper towels. The view out the back is phenomenal! Having cable TV was nice- was able to watch live games. And an earlier than usual check-in time made us choose this house over others. Will stay here again.

The hot water was not working in the shower the first night, it was tepid. It was fixed the second day. Three of the lights in the room were out and needed light bulbs replaced. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was reported as not working and was not fixed during our stay. I would not recommend this hotel room to any one. In addition to the issues with the lights hot water and exhaust fan the orange throw (pictures in the room ad) on one of the beds was dirty. The lamps were old and the shade on the lamp between the beds was dirty and had holes in it. The wires were exposed on the chord to the lamp that sat on the desk. The curtains were dirty. We could not reach the front desk by phone. No one picked up the call. There were no bedspreads or comforters on the beds. We asked the front desk for 2 extra blankets and they gave us clean white comforters. The people at the check in desk did not keep your room number private they spoke it aloud as you were given a key. 
The breakfast was good and the location was very convenient. It was quiet.

malaga stay - winter sun february 2023
----
Loved this large top floor apartment in a great position on Calle Pacifico with access to the wonderful Paseo Marítimo Antonio Banderas (14k sea front stretching to the other side of the city to Playa La Malgueta).

Check in was smooth at the office in central Malaga where we were allowed to store our luggage until 4pm.

The apartment was clean & the large balcony became an afternoon sun trap after midday during February.
Beds were firm & comfortable & showers plentiful with good pressure & hot water. Air conditioning/ heating kept most rooms warm when the temperatures dropped in the evenings.

Location was everything: Quiet & although the apartment is about 2.75k from central Malaga we loved the walk along the seafront. Bus services the regular (No’s 40 & 7). Running & scooter rides along the front really made the break. 
Plenty of excellent local restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the apartment negating the need to go into central Malaga. Particularly liked La Mafia, Terra Mia and Taco Box.

Some not so positives in our experience were:

- No hand wash in bathrooms or kitchen ( important post Covid I would have thought) rather than tiny soaps.
- No plugs in the bathrooms/ kitchen - difficult to have a quick wash or clean plates & cups in the kitchen.
- Kettle was very small & difficult to use. Looked unsafe (electric wiring exposed) & hot steam vented on to your hand when pouring.

Let me preface this with: THIS HOUSE IS GORGEOUS. It is huge, beautifully decorated, and well stocked. Those complaining about having to supply certain items obviously do not stay in villas very often. The pool was great, warm and tons of fun for the kids. We brought our own pool toys and games and threw them away prior to departure. Loved the room set up, location of the house, community security, etc. We take 1-2 trips to Florida each year. It’s been our family tradition for over 18 years and we always rent villas. This was our first rental with Blue Skies and I must say, I was impressed with their policies, how communicative/responsive they were (love the text feature!). Challenges with the house: when we arrived, at check in, the cleaners were still inside cleaning. No biggie, but we had been waiting at the clubhouse for HOURS and were ready to settle in. The house was clean, but there was a bandaid in the pool (we scooped it out with the net), the projector was broken (was a bummer but we didn’t care enough to contact the management company, there is soooo many other things to do! Like splash in the pool!!), and to our horror, there is seemingly a roach infestation. There are large size water bugs or cockroaches in the upstairs area (mainly saw in the master bedroom and laundry room), but there are what seem to be German (??) cockroaches that have infested the kitchen area. The first one we saw was dead in the master bedroom on the main level, but then we started seeing them throughout the kitchen. Drawers, on the stove, cabinets, and hiding in dishwasher. We bought raid, and lots of Lysol spray and wipes, but knew it wasn’t the solve. I contacted management and they sent an exterminator IMMEDIATELY, which was appreciated, but didn’t solve the issue either. I am not quite sure why there is a possible infestation because the house is CLEAN. The only thing I can think is because the fridge is leaking water from the freezer or whatever the water source is and perhaps that draws them? Not sure. But other than that, the house was great. We did wash all of our clothes in hot soapy water the night before we left, folded, and placed IMMEDIATELY in our LYSOLED suitcases and placed DIRECTLY in the rental van to ensure we didn’t bring any unwanted guests/hitchhikers home with us. All that said, I would rent from Blue Skies again, just maybe not this house. Which is shameful because it’s BEAUTIFUL. (And no, never experienced bugs in any other villa.)

not as described

This is the worst property that my family and I have ever stayed at and the management is a reflection of that as well. Pictures are deceiving to the actual property (pictures were enhanced for false advertisement). When we got to the property a lot of things were broken and in our way and stayed like that until we left because maintenance didn't take with. Maintenance was still working there pass 4pm check in time until about 5:30pm. We had issues with the key and code at the beginning. Cockroaches and bugs everywhere at night and during the day, yes there was no food on the counter when they came out, no WIFI, someone changed the name to it so no Wi-Fi and I had to go to the nearest Starbucks to do my college schoolwork. No laundry card as promised, our laundry unit on the 14th floor was closed due to repair, no cleaning supplies or typical things that are suppose to be provided to keep the place neat, we had to buy it ourselves. Mold and rust in the bathroom and other places. There was more that I didn't mention. We were changed extra $140 for a blow up mattress that was described as an extra bed. You are charged a $250 cleaning fee, not sure for what because
our place wasn't even that clean (we left it cleaner than when we arrived to it). Very old property, very outdated, even the guys who run the place say that everything else is updated
and this is the only place that isn't up to date and the host that runs it doesn't care. First Aid kit isn't even up to standard, fire extinguisher was not secured. The first couple of days only 1 elevator worked so we had to carry all our luggage by stairs (14 flights).

Mold and rust in the bathroom and other places. There was more that I didn't mention. We were changed extra $140 for a blow up mattress that was described as an extra bed. You are charged a $250 cleaning fee, not sure for what because
our place wasn't even that clean (we left it cleaner than when we arrived to it). Very old property, very outdated, even the guys who run the place say that everything else is updated
and this is the only place that isn't up to date and the host that runs it doesn't care. First Aid kit isn't even up to standard, fire extinguisher was not secured.

great place

We loved our stay here. The place has everything you need for an extended stay. We stayed for three weeks and bought a vegetable steamer which we left at the property. Pics are accurate but we were told that the throw pillows were for staging only. Those are important to us for lumbar back support. The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues. That means it is mostly an issue with the router, not the modem or the internet connection to the property itself. Although, normal router was still good for YouTube or Netflix. The place was clean but I would say it needs a deep clean. Shower pan is one example. The bed is comfortable and linens are top notch. We did find baby cockroaches in the kitchen area and bathroom and bought the roach motel thing at the market. This is Hawaii and so, we weren’t surprised but also not great. Just keep your food containers sealed or in the refrigerator. Another con is the proximity to the pool and jacuzzi. Both can get loud at times. But noise cuts off if you close lanai door. Also, everyone is out of the pool area by 10 pm. The pro is that the unit is really super close to the pool and jacuzzi and we enjoyed them quite a bit. All in all, we would come back.

okay in a pinch

The complex this unit is in is very nice with a beautiful pool, nice beach and great views. That said, this unit is only okay. The unit itself is nicely furnished. However, it has a number of drawbacks. First, there were big reddish cockroaches in the kitchen. The location is tropical, so we did not freak out too much about the roaches. Second, the unit sits on top of the office and laundry room for the complex. In itself this is not a big issue, but everyday there were maintenance people hosing off stuff right outside our window at about 6:00 AM. Also, there are parking lots on 2 1/2 sides of the building, so people driving/parking/talking at night were noticeable. Moreover, one jalousie windows in the master bedroom would not close all the way because vines had grown up into the window. I tried to move the vines out, but I couldn't get to them because the knobs that hold the screen on were rusted closed. The slightly open windows made the noise worse. Third, there is an ocean view from the living room, but it is very distant. The unit is farther from the water than any other unit and the ocean view is between two buildings. That sounds a little worse than it is. The two buildings are far apart, so the view is okay, but quite distant.
Finally, all the interior doors are louvered, so privacy is impaired somewhat. I would recommend that at least the bathroom door be converted into a solid door.

great place, nice location, great pool, but bring bug spray.

Upon arrival I was greatly impressed with the modern, updated house! It’s very spacious and the heated salt water pool is fantastic! I was already planning in my head a 5 star review. HOWEVER, in the middle of the night when my daughter went to use the restroom she noticed a large bug in the bathroom. None of us thought too much of this except for when the next day we came home from being gone most of the evening and my son found a roach on his backpack, and upon further searching the house there were three roaches found throughout the kitchen and also one in the master bathroom. Now we are up to SIX roaches. That is disturbing! It gets worse. Eventually a palmetto roach the size of a small mouse crawls out from underneath the couch. After we called the next day and reported the infestation someone dropped off some bug spray for us to use and said “Hey, it’s Florida and we have roaches.” 

On Sunday night I lift up the lid of the washing machine to do laundry and there is a live roach sitting on the inside lid ledge of the washing machine. 

I am having a hard time wanting to recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone else because I’m afraid they would experience the same roach problem too.

I had insomnia during our stay because I was worried about the roaches crawling into my bed. I was also concerned about possibly bringing roaches home with us in our suitcases and bags. For the price we paid, I would not expect roaches to be in this nice of a place.

We tried reaching out to the property manager after our stay, but no one responded to our emails or tried contacting us.

The sliding door jammed shut. No reply from the emergency number when rung repeatedly, so we forced the door open. The property is infested with cocroaches that come out in the late evening. The pots and pans need replacing. An aircon would assist in the hot weather we experienced, and not having any internet is a drag. This sounds like we had a bad experience, but no, we generally had a lovely time and enjoyed this small, quaint cottage immensly. Wooli is great, and my first experience of this area.

Positiv:
-Lage zum Strand ist gut

Negativ:
Es war ein furchtbarer und ekelhafter Aufenthalt! Wir haben alle Mängel aufgelistet & aussagekräftige Bilder an die Vermieter (VM) geschickt. Diese haben die Mängel nicht wahrhaben wollen & gemeint, wir würden mit der Lupe danach suchen. Leider gibt es in der Bewertungsfunktion keine Möglichkeit Bilder hochzuladen & nur begrenztes Zeichenlimit. Die Bilder wären für jeden erschreckend!
1. Kakerlaken: Es sind viele Kakerlaken in der Küche unter der Spüle. Sie kommen nachts raus & sind morgens neben dem Bett, unter den Schuhen, neben der Kommode usw. Wir zeigten das Problem & man sagte uns, wir sollen Insektizid als Spray holen & einfach überall hinsprühen. Dies ist nicht nur gesundheitsschädlich, es half auch nicht. Bis zur Abreise Kakerlaken in der Wohnung! Viele wären direkt abgereist.
2. Dusche kaputt: Der Duschhalter ist doppelt kaputt, um Höhe & Winkel einzustellen. Wir mussten Kabelbinder für 5 Cent kaufen, um die Brause zu fixieren. Das Geld wollte VM nicht geben & bedrohte uns, dass wir das wieder abmachen sollen bei Auszug. Irre!
3. Wasserschaden: Über der Brause trat einige Tage nach Anreise ein Wasserschaden auf. Die Decke platzte herunter, die Farbe rieselte tagelang in die Dusche. Es war alles total staubig in der Dusche, Abfluss wurde dadurch verstopft.
4. Hellhörigkeit / Glascontainer: Direkt vor der Wohnung in 3m Entfernung zur Haustüre ist ein Glascontainer, in den 24/7 eingeworfen wird. Extrem laut, nachts wird man dadurch geweckt! Spanien ist hellhörig. Aber diese Wohnung übertrifft einfach alles. Nebenan hört man sogar Handy der Nachbarn vibrieren, oberhalb Getrampel, diagonal oberhalb Hundegebell & Wettrennen in der Wohnung mit dem Hund, von vorne dann der Glascontainer.
5. Balkon: Markise kaputt. Griff zum Aufmachen abgebrochen + rostig. Markisenstoff zerfleddert, sieht aus wie aus dem Altkleidercontainer. Antennenkabel hängt genau auf Kopfhöhe von links n. rechts mitten durch gesamten Balkon! Meerblick von innen nur in Kombination mit störendem Kabel. Wie im Dritte-Welt-Land!
6. Ameisen: In der gesamten Küche überall Ameisen. Gehen sogar IN die geschl. Spülmaschine rein. KEINE Lebensmittel außerhalb Mikrowelle / Kühlschrank lagern, sie kommen überall ran!
7. Einrichtung: Sessel abgenutzt, 0 Kleiderhaken, Regale Bad wackelig, fingerdicke Staubschicht auf Ventilator, Balkontisch total verdreckt
8. VM nach Mängelanzeige, wir sollen Whg. sofort verlassen oder ab sofort den Mund halten

Positive:
-Lage to the beach is good

Negative:
It was a terrible and disgusting stay! We have listed all defects & sent meaningful images to the landlords (VM). These did not want to admit the shortcomings & we mean that we would look for it with the magnifying glass. Unfortunately, there is no way to upload pictures in the evaluation function & only limited drawing limit. The pictures would be terrifying for everyone!
1. Cockroaches: There are many cockroaches in the kitchen under the sink. They come out at night & are next to the bed in the morning, under the shoes, next to the chest of drawers, etc. We showed the problem & we told us that we should get insecticide as a spray & just spray everywhere. This is not only harmful to health, it didn't help either. Until the departure, cockroaches in the apartment! Many would have left directly.
2. Shower broken: The shower holder is double broken to set height & angle. We had to buy cable ties for 5 cents to fix the shower. VM did not want to give the money & threatened us that we should take it off again when moving out. Crazy!
3. Water damage: A water damage occurred a few days after arrival. The ceiling burst down, the color ranged into the shower for days. Everything was totally dusty in the shower, drain was clogged.
4. Heading hearing / glass container: directly in front of the apartment at 3m away to the front door is a glass container in which 24/7 is thrown in. Extremely loud, you will be awakened at night! Spain is noisy. But this apartment just exceeds everything. Next door you can even hear the neighbors' cell phone vibrating, above hits, diagonally above dog bark & ​​race in the apartment with the dog, from the front then the glass container.
5. Balcony: awning broken. Grip broken off + rusty. Sprented the awning fabric looks like from the old clothing container. Antenna cable hangs exactly at the head height from the left and right in the middle of the entire balcony! Sea view from the inside only in combination with a disturbing cable. As in the third world country!
6. Ants: Ants everywhere in the entire kitchen. Go even into the closed. Dishwasher in. No foods outside microwave / fridge, you can get everywhere!
7. Furnishing: armchair worn out, 0 clothes hooks, shelves bathroom shaky, finger -thick stem layer on the fan, balcony totally dirty
8. VM after notification of defects, we should leave it immediately or keep our mouths immediately

This is the worst property that my family and I have ever stayed at and the management is a reflection of that as well. Pictures are deceiving to the actual property (pictures were enhanced for false advertisement). When we got to the property a lot of things were broken and in our way and stayed like that until we left because maintenance didn't take with. Maintenance was still working there pass 4pm check in time until about 5:30pm. We had issues with the key and code at the beginning. Cockroaches and bugs everywhere at night and during the day, yes there was no food on the counter when they came out, no WIFI, someone changed the name to it so no Wi-Fi and I had to go to the nearest Starbucks to do my college schoolwork. No laundry card as promised, our laundry unit on the 14th floor was closed due to repair, no cleaning supplies or typical things that are suppose to be provided to keep the place neat, we had to buy it ourselves. Mold and rust in the bathroom and other places. There was more that I didn't mention. We were changed a lot for a blow up mattress that was described as an extra bed. You are charged an enormous cleaning fee $$, not sure for what because our place wasn't even that clean (we left it cleaner than when we arrived to it). Very old property, very outdated, even the guys who run the place say that everything else is updated
and this is the only place that isn't up to date and the host that runs it doesn't care. First Aid kit isn't even up to standard, fire extinguisher was not secured. The first couple of days only 1 elevator worked so we had to carry all our luggage by stairs (14 flights). We were required to do our own dishes upon leaving which I didn't have an issue with besides it not being properly sanitary for the next people to come or for those who were here before us, how do we know that it was actually done sanitary up to code for people not to get sick or diseases. I sent the message to the host requesting a refund and informing of the issue, but the host didn't even have a decency to reply back or acknowledge her mistakes. Stove is outdated same as the fridge. We tried getting another hotel the second night we were there but we couldn't get anything due to it being booked out and we paid around way too much $$ for a week, way overcharged. I could have gotten a Hilton property for cheaper than that.

nice unit but cockroaches and other issues
----
My family and I stayed in December 2022 for 8 days. The unit was easy to find and the area was very nice. When we first checked in, we noticed no welcome booklet so we figured out the wifi/tv ourselves. We had to message the villa manager for the pool access code. The welcome nuts and chocolates were nice. The dryer was broken and stayed broken the entire stay. Previous reviews mentioned beach items but we did not see any except for some beach towels, which were tossed in a pile on top of the washing machine. (not sure if they were clean or dirty but since they weren't folded, I'm assuming they were dirty.) The biggest issue was the cockroach infestation. There were MANY in the kitchen/dining area. They were crawling in the dishwasher, on the dishes, on the floor, over the stove, day and night, every day of our stay. I messaged the owner and the villa manager about the cockroaches and the dryer but nothing was resolved. The owner did reply letting us know the last pest treatment was on November 30th but it obviously didn't have the effect it should have. After a few days, we stopped cooking in the kitchen altogether as it was unhygienic and stressful. We spoke to the downstairs neighbour who said she was also having a similar pest problem and that it was pretty bad this season. They were German cockroaches which are famous for being quite difficult to get rid of. Thankfully we didn't bring any home with us which I was worried about. Besides these issues, the place was spacious and the view was lovely.

just ok

We booked mostly for the air hockey table, which didn’t blow enough air to work properly so that was disappointing. Carpet had been vacuumed and sinks and toilets were clean but the place badly needs a deep clean. Walls and baseboards and window ledges were filthy. The mini blinds in the “kids” room (bunk bed room) were all broken so the kids were up with the sun. The floors are entirely splitting and coming up in several areas, a real trip hazard for a toddler or elderly. The furniture was equally beat up, the chair in the living room looked like it was rescued from a curb. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen. Sponges were scary dirty, thankfully we brought our own of all of these things…washed every dish before we used it, especially the utensils, because the drawers were so gross inside. The lights over the dining room table didn’t work and the remote control lights for the other rooms were wonky, my daughter was trying to turn hers on and it turned mine off. As for the pros: good location, we felt safe, good size yard to play in and plenty of space for a family or two. We enjoyed the sleds they provided. I really liked the cubbies in the kitchen and all the rooms. Check in was easy and host was communicative. The place has potential but really needs some attention. I understand new flooring is expensive but at minimum the place needs a deep cleaning and new blinds in the one room, and that would cost less than we paid for our stay so I just don’t understand why it’s not been done.

Everything about this property was great except the heater situation. With a 2 year old who doesn't keep clothes or blankets on I need a warm house. With the thermostat that has settings set to go back to 56 every 2 hours it was a rough couple of nights for us. Cold family and cold and fussy baby was not fun. Heat does turn yes, but settings don't allow it to stay the temp to keep warm. Its like fighting with the thermostat all night. Hopefully owner can get settings changed so no one else has an uncomfortable stay. Also does have pellet stove and a tiny space heater in closet but don't feel safe with small children leaving these things on at night. Heat from heater would have been best for us.

not a good fit
----
After much thought, my husband and I would give this a 3 out of 5. It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child.

I’m highly disappointed with this booking.


This was a new year reservation.
My parents and my brother’s family with my new born were traveling to Redding and booked the best stay (from our side based on reviews) for 2 nights.
My wife went inside and put the infant on the bed for sometime. 
After couple of minutes, we found the bed bugs (shared photo with VRBO & owner) in every room and decided it wasn’t safe for the baby. These can latch on and spread in car/ clothes/home.
I called the vrbo support immediately and they told me to send the photos. They reviewed it throughly and I was on the phone for more than an hour. They confirmed it was a health hazard and asked me to book another stay for 3 family for JUST that night.
I quickly found a nearby hotel, spent the night there.
Instead of 2 nights, I spent just one. I traveled for more than 6 hours to reach redding from my place.
Doing more than 12 hours of travel in a day, rushing from one place to another with kids and elderly in the night, spending time figuring out hotels, cutting short the program were not what I was looking forward to on starting a new year.😔

I have been booking through VRBO for a while now, and never had an issue.

When I contacted vrbo support about the health & safety issues here, they told me to book another stay for 6 adults and kid. I provided all the supporting documentation. It's been more than 1 month and I haven't got a refund for hotel stay from Owner or home stay from owner.

First the good. The property itself is very nice. It has everything you need: towels, linens, spices in the kitchen, and a hot-tub. Location is about 10 minutes from Vail Village.

Now the bad. The issue my group ran into was the property management company (Vacasa) is terrible. When we arrived at the house there was a deceased mouse caught in a mousetrap on the living room floor next to the couch. I looked under the couch and saw two additional set mousetraps which were near the edge of the couch. If you have children that is a huge hazard considering later in the trip I accidentally stepped on one. We also observed and photographed mice feces under the master bedroom bed. I contacted Vacasa immediately and made them aware of the situation and was told that a cleaner would come out immediately. A cleaner never showed so we discarded the mouse ourselves and I called Vacasa again the next day to ask for cleaning stuff to be sent out. They apologized for the inconvenience and again said a cleaner would be out shortly. Hours went by so I called again and requested to speak with a manager. The manager said a cleaner would be out shortly, but never showed. I continuously contacted Vacasa for three days until they finally sent out a cleaner to take care of the mice feces. It took literally 3 days to get someoen to clean up the feces. 

Received a $500 refund on a $3200 + trip.

The view was stunning, location was great and the size of the house was good for our large family. However the state of the property is not as it is portrayed. There were lights out in every room, door handles did not work properly, furniture is very tired looking and uncomfortable, the pool table is ripped and looks dreadful, just to name a few things. Another thing is that it is not child friendly/safe at all as it only has star pickets and rope as a fence with a 2 metre or more drop. It would be good if these things could be rectified moving forward so that others can have a better experience. Regards Helen

great place but needs cleaning.

We really enjoyed the location, the layout of the house and the spaciousness of it, also that it had great kitchen equipment. It really served us well. Unfortunately it was not clean upon arrival. After a long drive to Napier, we vacuumed the very dusty floors and a very dusty (and stained) couch with a lot of debri under the cushions. Also, the kitchen floor was really dirty. We tried to find a mop and the only mop had a spare new mophead in the laundry, but it didn't fit. Also, there was no spray and wipe. So we bought a new mophead and a refil bottle of spray and wipe that we used while there and left the rest behind. It was nice to see the place was environmentally friendly with their supplied products. I took the liberty to remove a net curtain in the front bedroom with black mould on it and left it in the laundry. The lights in the lounge flickered a lot and the bulb was dead in the dining room. As they are large bulbs, I wasn't sure where to get a replacement. There was chewing gum stuck on the door handle in the kitchen and mouse poo under the kitchen window squab. So, we did a bit of a spring clean and then we felt great. Nice pottery in the cupboards, that we admired while there. To be fair it is a really great place to stay and we loved being there. Nice and airy and light. There was a sticker on the toilet roll when we arrived that said Gem Cleaning Services, so it may be that the property manager needs to give them some feedback.

magical dream villa

This villa was in a great and easy location. The home was clean and well stocked with plenty of dishes, cookware and linens. Glassware was lacking comparison to all the dinnerware and needed to be restocked. There were 6 water glasses and 1 wine glass. I would recommend more wine and juice glasses as well as a few more acrylic glasses for use at the pool.
Additionally, some of the information provided in the house book was not updated such as the wi fi password and tv instructions. We only found the tv information by accident a day later as it was posted on the outside back cover of the loose leaf and not inside with all the other information. It did not match with the remote provided. These, however, were minor and did not at all impact our stay. We would definitely rent here again.

great location!

Great location to the slopes and resort amenities. Spacious and accommodated everyone in our group. Host was very responsive and kind.

Be sure to bring toilet paper because there is a limited amount even though listing does not stipulate to bring more outside of 2 rolls per bathroom.

We cooked every meal but did not have any food storage options(Tupperware) for leftovers.

While this is a great location and very spacious, the king beds are very worn down and have big impressions in them which make it hard to get comfortable and sleep well.

When we arrived, there were past guest’s supplies left in the fridge, one tv had been damaged prior to our stay, lights out and flickering in fridge and microwave, and dishwasher did not really clean the dishes. There was a white film on all the dishes and they had to be washed prior to using.

Again, we had a wonderful time and it is a great location for a family ski trip, just a few considerations would have made it even better!

We enjoyed our short stay at this small, yet lovely unit. The outside of the property needs a bit of work (and not just because of hurricane damage) but inside, this particular unit seems to have been recently updated, is very clean, and offers a stunning ocean view. Entry access was clearly communicated and parking was no problem. LOVED the plush bath towels. We brought our own beach towels but unfortunately, never used them as we happened to be there during very chilly (and windy) weather! I found the king mattress to be comfortable but noisy…anytime my husband moved, it woke me up and my daughter said she could hear it from where she was on the sleeper sofa pullout (which she said was very comfortable). I’m not sure if that king mattress is new and just needs to be broken in or what. Overall, we really enjoyed this place and recommend it for anyone looking for a clean, relaxing place to stay. Also, the owners left a nice touch - when we arrived, there were snack bags and soap/bath/shampoo items on the large kitchen island counter! Thank you!

The house was a place to sleep - unfortunately, we are unable to call it much more than that.

A few disappointments included:
1) a fair amount of un-repaired and non-disclosed hurricane damage
2) incredibly uncomfortable beds & pillows
3) basic (standard) items were not included (ex. hand soap, toilet paper, paper towels, garbage bags, dish soap, hangers)

7) cupboards and closet doors were falling off hinges
8) canal dock lights did not work
9) pool remote did not work, therefore we could not heat it (to be fair, we did not call to ask this be fixed)

That’s not to say there weren’t pros:
1) beautiful sunsets on the canal
2) walking distance to many places
3) quiet neighborhood
4) there were 2 king beds and our kids LOVED having a double bunk bed room
5) neighborhood duck came to visit daily
6) beach buckets and shovels were available
7) early check-in approval
8) fast booking confirmation
9) friendly & helpful rep answered the phone when we arrived

Word of warning, beware of all the charges on top of rental and cleaning – combined these accounted for nearly 40% of our bill!

While the house met our needs as a place to sleep and eat occasional meals, it’s not a property we could recommend without a fair amount of TLC.

Don't have roaches.I'm 64 years old and never had roaches.We killed at least 8 roaches.They think they're doing me a favor by giving me $165.00..0 rating in all category.I got another VRBO in Dennis port Mass .I'm gonna cancel .It was dirty linen on the beds and roaches .Next time it something else like bed bugs etc.

For only $80 per night it was an ok stay. On the day of check-in I didn’t get any information from the host. 2hr before arrival I had to message the host and ask which apt was ours and how to get in. We weren’t given an apt number so we mistakenly tried to open two other doors before we found ours. Walking into the apt there was a strange smell and the bathroom smelled worse, like dirty pipes and poor ventilation for moisture. The shower wand needs to be changed, it’s so caked up with mineral buildup and mold that the stream that you get from it, is basically drops. The linoleum tiles in the bathroom are lifting because of the moisture and there was mold in the shower. And the water control didn’t really work, we had to play around with it to get a comfortable temperature otherwise the water would constantly go back and forth from very cold to scalding. The sheets on the bed weren’t clean, we found hair and just other debris and my sister would find red dots on herself the next couple days. There weren’t bed bugs so I’m assuming it was just a reaction to the sheets being dirty, but we did find ants in the apt.

It was our first time to Costa Rica and hopefully not the last. The condo was larger than we thought and the quiet location was everything we expected and more. It is walking distance to many restaurants, and there were 2 grocery stores near by. We found the one store that was a little further of a walk (5 minutes vs 2) to be a better value. 
The beach was quiet and we enjoyed a daily morning walk. Everyone was friendly in the area and we felt safe our entire trip.

The owner was very good at communicating. 
The house itself is in a nice community, and very well located for access to expressways to take us anywhere in the LA area.
It was such a large house that it could accommodate our whole family. The hot water was plentiful once it got through the pipes. The table and chairs in the dining room were at normal height, thankfully, not hightop. The TV was really large. The washer and dryer were used a lot, with all of us, and they worked well. Beds were very low and soft.
Gas leak was detected. We contacted the landlord, and the employee switched our faulty stove with another stove from a nearby rental that was empty. We were concerned about that stove in another rental in future weeks.
The soft-cushioned, white leather couch was badly grimed with dirt, and therefore, not sanitary, especially for our toddler.
The first load of dishes showed the dishwasher incapable of cleaning the dishes; and thereafter, dishes had to be hand-washed.
The weekly cleaning was well-done with care by the cleaners, concerned that we had sufficient clean blankets, etc. Under the couch, between the cushions, behind the appliances, and edges of the floor near the walls, had not been thoroughly cleaned recently.
Decide for yourselves if you wish to take the chance for soft, low furnishings and if the problems have been fixed.

bien situé mais besoin de travaux
----
Nous avons loué cette propriété pour trois semaines avec nos trois enfants de 10 mois à 5 ans. Commençons par le positif: la localisation est idéale pour visiter le Sud de l’île mais également le centre, voire le Nord si on n’a pas peur de faire un peu de route. La maison est relativement spacieuse et le voisinage tranquille (quand les chiens des voisins ne jappent pas). Cuisine quand même bien équipée mais pourrait être mieux. Par contre, il y a plusieurs importants points négatifs à mentionner. Tout d’abord, le système de plomberie est déficient ou mériterait un entretien sérieux. De fortes odeurs nauséabondes d’urine et d’excréments ont embaumé notre séjour pendant plusieurs jours. La table de la salle à manger est brisée (bois en surface pourri et endommagé) et doit être remplacée. Les matériaux (surfaces, planchers, moulures, etc.) sont endommagés à plusieurs endroits: salle d’eau, salle de bain, cuisine et chambres. Les matelas sont très durs et inconfortables. Autres points à améliorer: le drain de douche est bouché, le moustiquaire de la chambre à l’étage ne ferme pas bien, la terrasse est très endommagée, des têtes de vis sortent du bois à plusieurs endroits (très dangereux pour s’y prendre les pieds). Enfin, les communications avec l’hôte en cours de séjours ont été ardues. La gestionnaire de la propriété ne répond pas aux mails le weekend et il nous a fallu deux suivis pour qu’une action soit entreprise en lien avec le problème d’odeurs émanant de la plomberie. La ville a coupé l’eau deux soirs de suite sans que nous ayons été avisés par l’hôte, nous privant de prendre des bains et douches (y compris les enfants), ce qui était inacceptable dans les circonstances. Des avis semblaient pourtant avoir été déposés dans la boîte postale mais n’ont pas été ramassés par la gestionnaire, nous empêchant ainsi d’en être informés à l’avance et prendre des dispositions appropriées. Aussi, elle est entré dans la maison en cours de séjour alors que nous n’y étions pas, sans nous aviser au préalable, ce qui nous a semblé intrusif dans notre intimité. Nous trouvions important de mentionner ces divers problèmes ici car pour le prix payé, nous nous attentions à mieux, autant de la propriété comme telle que de l’hôte, que nous avons trouvé peu professionnelle. Heureusement, les points positifs mentionnés ci-dessus ont rendu notre expérience agréable dans son ensemble.

Well located but need work
----
We rented this property for three weeks with our three children from 10 months to 5 years old. Let's start with the positive: the location is ideal for visiting the south of the island but also the center, or even the north if you are not afraid to make a little road. The house is relatively spacious and the neighborhood quiet (when the dogs of the neighbors do not jap). Kitchen anyway well equipped but could be better. On the other hand, there are several important negative points to mention. First, the plumbing system is deficient or deserves serious maintenance. Strong foul smells of urine and excrement hired our stay for several days. The dining room table is broken (wood on a rotten and damaged surface) and must be replaced. Materials (surfaces, floors, moldings, etc.) are damaged in several places: shower room, bathroom, kitchen and bedrooms. The mattresses are very hard and uncomfortable. Other points to improve: the shower drain is blocked, the mosquito net of the bedroom upstairs does not close well, the terrace is very damaged, screw heads come out of the wood in several places (very dangerous to do it the feet). Finally, communications with the host during stays were arduous. The owner of the property does not respond to emails on weekends and it took us two follow -ups for an action to be undertaken in connection with the problem of odors emanating from plumbing. The city cut the water two evenings in a row without our having been informed by the host, depriving us of taking baths and showers (including children), which was unacceptable in the circumstances. However, opinions seemed to have been filed in the postal box but were not picked up by the manager, thus preventing us from being informed in advance and taking appropriate arrangements. Also, she entered the house during the stay while we were not there, without notifying ourselves beforehand, which seemed intrusive in our intimacy. We found it important to mention these various problems here because for the price paid, we were careful, as much of property as such as the host, that we found little professional. Fortunately, the positive points mentioned above made our experience pleasant as a whole.

fantastic location and great property
----
We are a family of 5 and the property was fantastic. Spotlessly clean and well equipped kitchen. Easy access to the slopes and Main Street. Check in was a breeze - we arrived at 1am and got straight in. 
Downsides (if being really fussy). The master bedroom is a little small with a bed that is too big for the room. Would have preferred a smaller bed and the ability to get out of bed from both sides rather than being against the wall.

fantastic location and great property

We are a family of 5 and the property was fantastic. Spotlessly clean and well equipped kitchen. Easy access to the slopes and Main Street. Check in was a breeze - we arrived at 1am and got straight in. 
Downsides (if being really fussy). The master bedroom is a little small with a bed that is too big for the room. Would have preferred a smaller bed and the ability to get out of bed from both sides rather than being against the wall.

Eine wunderschöne Unterkunft mit Fußbodenheizung, die leider nicht vorher an war. Außentemperatur identisch mit Innentemperatur (6 Grad). Heizkörper im Bad defekt, konnte uns also auch nicht retten.
Wir haben noch nie so gefroren. Mit allen auftreibbaren Decken, in Skikleidung und mit Mütze (kein Witz) ins Bett. Nächster Morgen noch immer extrem kalt. An Duschen nicht zu denken. Flucht zum Ausflug. Abends dann oben warm und unten einigermaßen ok. Eine Fußbodenheizung muss eben erst anlaufen. Nach Anruf morgens kam der Hausmeister, der feststellte, dass der Heizkörper im Bad defekt ist. Fazit: Montag Anreise, Dienstag Ausflug, Mitwoch Abreise . Die Familie nach uns hatte sicher einen schöneren Aufenthalt. Unser Kind sollte an der Küste ein wenig gesunden. Stattdessen haben wir einen Abend, eine Nacht und einen Morgen unendlich gefroren. Seit Freitag hat sie nun Fieber...

Frozen to death in a beautiful apartment

A wonderful accommodation with underfloor heating, which unfortunately was not previously on. Outside temperature identical to internal temperature (6 degrees). Radiators in the bathroom defect, so it couldn't save us either.
We have never frozen. With all the blankets that can be found, in ski clothing and with a hat (no joke) to bed. Next morning still extremely cold. Not to think of showering. Escape to the trip. Then warm in the evening and ok at the bottom. Underfloor heating has to start. After calling, the caretaker came in the morning, who found that the radiator is defective in the bathroom. Conclusion: Monday arrival, Tuesday excursion, Wednesday departure. The family after us certainly had a nicer stay. Our child should be a little healthy on the coast. Instead, we frozen an evening, one night and one morning. Since Friday she has had a fever ...
The apartment itself is beautiful and well equipped. We also do not rule out to come back in summer ...

30A-Vacations was outstanding! The property is amazing and it was truly a pleasure being able to enjoy the property and 30A-Vacations outstanding service. When I originally booked the place it had a lot of availability, I imagined because it’s new. Agreeing seeing everything, I know that’s the case! I’ve got no doubt that this’ll be one that fills up quickly in the future! My family and I will be on it! Three things to note:

1) If you get stuck between floors in the elevator outside of business hours, try all possible fix actions first. Then call the fire department. That emergency number that’s given to you is not a 24 hour emergency line.

2) If you want hot tub / pool heating access during your stay, communicate that ahead of time.(At least 3 days) I missed that memo and in turn missed out on the hot fun. :(

3) Have a blast!

Thanks again 30A

Everyone got a good night's sleep, which was especially essential during that time, but yes, there was laughter on that comfy couch as we shared stories about Pops.

disappointing rental

We are a group of 5 over 65 who have been renting homes for the past 6 years. This was our worst experience ever. We were told 12 days before check-in that the house was sold and were offered a different house with the same landlord. Upon arrival we found food in the fridge and clothes in the drawers. The property manager was not sure who they belonged to. Most of the kitchen drawers and downstairs closet were stuffed with things used in the remodeling/redecorating and had to be moved to allow for our things. The floors were swept but very dusty. The kitchen counters are nice but the island and cupboards are high and hard to access if your 5'5"" or under. The crispers in the fridge were frozen in place and even after we defrosted it there was water continually pooling in the bottom of the fridge during our entire month long stay. There is a nice backyard kitchen but we had to buy our own BBQ tank and utensils . The outdoor sink fills with the dirty water from the washing machine and leaves a horrible scum. The 6 foot ladder for the pool is ""floating"" and very unsafe. The property is fenced however there was no gate. The water in the bathtubs does not drain quickly so you are standing in inches of water while showering. There is no rod for hanging clothes downstairs and the TV did not have any reception and was not replaced until half way through our vacation. It is also in the bedroom so you have to sit on the very saggy bed to watch it. The upstairs living space is very tight. The rental sleeps 10 but only 3 or 4 people at most can sit on the sofas and the rest would need to sit on the dining room chairs. One of our ladies sat in a chair which broke when she pushed on the arms to stand up. The landlord is charging $300.00 for replacement of this one chair so be careful. The temperature fell to the low 60's for a couple days and there is no heat at all upstairs so it was very uncomfortable. The plug ins downstairs did not work and blew when trying to be repaired. Most of our vacation was spend trying to repair things or wait for repairs, lightbulbs etc. There are holes and gaps in the screened in porch. Neither of the dishwashers were secured to the counters so wobbled. There are no ""luxury"" touches like hair dryers or full length mirrors. The view is nice and there is a private park across the street but the key deposit is $600.00 and I am still waiting to get this back .

great heated pool house on a lake 5.6 mi to venice & 17mi to saint armands circle

This home has been updated recently. From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.
You will enjoy your stay at the Nokomis pool house.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.
You will enjoy your stay at the Nokomis pool house.

absolutely amazing property! every bit as good as we had hoped.

Absolutely AMAZING property! Every bit as good as we had hoped however, in terms of the condition of the property...

Property itself was missing a few basic items such as: no juicer, no baking dish, no sponges, no garbage bags for the under-bench rubbish bins, no paper towel and no olive oil.

The rubbish bins were full when we arrived and had not been emptied. 

There was also not hot water on arrival. 12 hours later we did eventually manage to get the hot water going ourselves.

The main blind in the master bedroom was broken as was the sliding door to the outside deck accessed from the master bedroom. One of the light bulbs was also blown in one of the beside lamps and there we no spare light bulbs in the house. 

The kitchen sink tap had a leak which the caused water to pool across the bench top. 

We found pieces of glass and bottle tops in the swimming pool and spa. There were sticky gummy bears stuck to the dining room chairs and the couch was covered in hair and pieces of popcorn.

The property itself is just superb. The location to the back beach is awesome. All that is needed is some better housekeeping to bring this property in line with the price point at which it is being pitched.

had construction scheduled during our vacation

On the second day of arrival we were told to move our vehicles so a dumpster could be placed in the driveway. There was no communication to us that they were going to be starting the roof the next morning - 7+ men showed up unexpectedly and started to cover the pool and hot tub forcing us out of the lanai area. We contacted Roelens property management several times daily by phone and emails and no one got back to us to update us, or assist us with these issues. They just passed it along to another person. Two days later, 15mins prior to a blind company showing up we received a phone call stating that they were coming from 10-2pm to install blinds. Complete invasion of our privacy, as they entered the house when we weren’t even home at the time of their arrival. Then the construction workers left cap nails scattered all in the pool, and hot tub area, which created a very unsafe environment. The workers parked a goose neck trailer in the driveway making it hard for us to park our vehicles safely. Again, no one had answers, no one reached out to let us know of the construction happening, it was a complete hazard of tools, material, and tarps left about the house. We’ve checked out of the house and it’s been 5 days without anyone getting back to us. This home shouldn’t have been able to rent during construction, and the home owners had not a care in the world that we were there renting, paying to be inconvenienced with noise, hazards, and construction during our vacation time. VERY Inconsiderate and very dangerous.

Sehr schönes Haus in toller Lage mit nur kurzem Weg zum Strand. Sehr gut ausgestattete Küche. Leider ist der Spitzboden offen, so dass für die obenschlafenden, sich der eigene Rhythmus am ersten und letzten der Gesellschaft früh und abends orientiert muss.

Very nice house in a great location with just a short way to the beach. Very well equipped kitchen. Unfortunately, the pointed floor is open, so that for those sleeping above, their own rhythm must be oriented early and in the evening.

Location was great, not walking distance to anything like the description said but, it was a short drive to anywhere in town. 
The previous users must have been smokers or its just poorly sanitized between users. The entire place smelled like cigarettes. 
The carpet was fraying and generally appeared filthy. 
2 of the 4 lounge chairs were broken, one had duck tape on it. 
The bed was extremely tall and too small for 2 people. 
The holes in the bathroom floor should really be addressed, it was concerning when showering that I was going to fall through the floor. 
There was no salt to put down outside on the back patio so it iced over after hot tub use. There was also some really moldy/soggy floor mats on the way into the cabin from the patio.
The hot tub cover should probably be replaced because every time we opened it debris fell out and the insulation was compromised because it would freeze over night. The skimmer net was so shredded you couldn't use it.

nice condo, low on amenities

The condo was nice, in a low key condo complex. Liked having the two restaurants (Gazebo breakfast is amazing!) and beach rental shop on site. Staff was friendly. Napili Bay beach is walking distance. Overall this area Fera more weather than other parts of Maui so beware (lots of wind and on and off rain when we were there in February). One complaint was they were doing a lot of work on the property when we were there - trimming/cutting down palm trees, draining and refilling the pool (so it was was closed for a day) which was a bit loud and inconvenient. Other main complaint was the unit had few dishes and amenities - no oil, foil, ziploc bags, beach chairs. Liked the two smart TVs though and bed was comfy!
