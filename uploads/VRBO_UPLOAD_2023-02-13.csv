cozy vacation in the woods

Spent a little over a month in the cabin and it was just what my family needed to relax and unwind. While it would have been nice to have a baby gate (or 2) and a crib we had a wonderful time. It was very cozy sitting in the middle of the woods. The oven set off the fire alarm every time we opened it but it was reassuring that they all worked! Greybeard’s management team was very helpful when we came to them with problems. Would be back again in a heartbeat.

We sure do like staying at Turtle Bay! Cathy’s place was certainly familiar to us and it helped make our trip great! I’m house laundry is sooo convenient! Check in was easy. The main toilet had trouble with refilling the tank and the smoke detector battery was low which resulted in chirping. We informed her about it and she was fixing to take care of it. The bed was plenty comfy. Windows and sliders open for a nice cross breeze. The place stayed plenty cool for us to sleep at night. Kitchen could have been better stocked with spices. Sift through some of the beach amenities to make sure they function well- both umbrellas we tried to bring with us were broken. But this is all very small stuff and we had a great time regardless! Love the North Shore!

Upon arriving, we found a note from the host that the furnace had quit working the day before our arrival. And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues.

Regular lack of water and frequent electricity failures made the stay less pleasant.Also, a dishwasher would have been a plus.
Thanks to Anne-Sophie for her availability.

Upon check-in, I was told by concierge that because of Covid, the property is only starting to see more visitors and that they were only looking for feedback on our stay & the employees.

I was also very clear that I was not interested in any sales pitch and was assured that was not the at all what this was. They lied.

Felt as if he could have been more forthcoming with what to expect. 

On the last day, the state was experiencing inclement weather & power outages. Given the property was only at 20% capacity, I reached out to Christian to ask if we could extend our stay 24 hours until the roads cleared and was told they could not since the reservation was completed. I was given the suggestion to the front desk and ask (which I did) only to be given the off the street room rate of 3.5x what we originally paid. I was shocked and disappointed. 

I will provide a thumbs up to the condo itself. It was clean, comfortable and perfectly suited for my family.

bien situé, agréable mais des petites choses à revoir
----: 
J'espère vivement que les petits points négatifs seront corrigés afin que je puisse revenir l'année prochaine.
Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle
Les 2 lits de l'alcôve sont HS.
Les serviettes de toilette mériteraient d’être renouvelées.
Il faudrait rajouter une glace (par exemple entre Wc et Sd’eau où l’on puisse se voir en entier
1 coup de peinture sur les murs serait la touche finale pour un appartement quasi parfait.

Well located, pleasant but small things to review
----:
I really hope that the small negative points will be corrected so that I can come back next year.
Positive points: ideally located close to everything.Home at the hotel next door.Very responsive owner if there is a problem.Very pleasant living room
Good to know: 2nd floor without elevator, 1 single single (6m2) and 1 alcove (6.5m2) closed by a sliding door welcoming 2 single beds without any storage or window.
In my opinion for 3 adults maximum or 2 adults + children.
Negative points: little things not very serious should be improved quickly.
Toilets: broken glasses, no WC brush (kitchen brush?)
Shower room: A bulb that works intermittently, no light on the ice that is impossible to make up.Shower outlet carpet to change.
Cuisine: Too little glass (3) The other 2 not stable on the table (Qatar World Cup glass), lack of skimmer and ladle and also plastic utensils (wooden spoon source of bacteria), the two large stoves areto change.Lack of cover in the trash
The 2 beds of the alcove are HS.
Towels deserve to be renewed.
We should add an ice cream (for example between WC and Sd’eau where we can see each other in full
1 paint on the walls would be the final touch for an almost perfect apartment.

honest review - underwhelmed
----: 
This is a fine house for a bunch of friends crashing for a few nights. You are paying for location, not quality of accommodations. Of note, this is unit #9 in the condo block. This is not listed in the check-in details and you will be left wandering around peering in windows trying to find the art that matches the listing photos until the manager calls you back. The only hint we got that we were in unit 9 was the name of the wifi network. 

There were three main issues with this property. 
1. The garage door was broken and we had to manage a service call while we were there (they fixed it in a haphazard way that required a light switch to be on in order to operate the door)
2. The dryer was broken. We were instructed that the dry mountain air is great for hang-drying. Fine, but for a week and 6 people we just had laundry hanging everywhere the entire time.  3. The management company said they had a cable person coming for a routine service, but asked us if we’d like to decline the visit. We said we’d like to decline and went on with our ski day. Later in the day I find out my mom was in the bathroom when a stranger let themselves into the house. After being super freaked out she learns it is the cable person. When pressed, the person said they used the code and let themselves in. In our opinion this was unacceptable and raises safety and security concerns. When we asked the management company to respond, they stopped responding to my messages and didn’t contact us again until they sent an automated check out message.

We’re reasonable renters and don’t expect perfection. We understand issues arise when you are staying in someone else’s home, but the combination of these three things (given the price of the rental) just amounted to too many problems and I was really disappointed that the management company ghosted us when I asked for a response. 

Pros:
3 minute walk to the poma t-bar. Location is excellent
Large mudroom where you can leave your skis and poles
Spacious bedrooms each with their own bathroom
Apple TV makes casting/music easy

Cons: 
Broken drier
Broken garage door
Unplowed driveway (they didn’t plow after a few snows and now it is just a compacted snow mess that is really challenging to drive over and treacherous to walk on)
Mildewy dish towels

We arrived to dirty dishes in the sink, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, a sink drain full of rotten food, and the garbage disposal smelled horrible. The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!

horrible - dirty and unsafe
----: 
We arrived to dirty dishes in the sink, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, a sink drain full of rotten food, and the garbage disposal smelled horrible. The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!

The house is in a great, quiet location. The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat. The property manager and owner said to leave the bedroom doors open and there are also 2 space heaters to heat the main areas. The space heaters were way to small to make a difference and the main areas were quite cold. None of the living room lights worked nor the living room fan, the pool was filthy, master bedroom faucet was loose, no cable, so no live TV, no garage door transmitters and the shower water pressure was not good. Due to having no heat in the main areas, we would not stay there again. We could look past all of the other issues, but with the main areas too cold to be in, we will look at other properties for our next visit.

Upon accessing the studio there was an overwhelming musty smell inside. The studio was tiny (as described) but the bathroom was smaller than imagined. If you are any taller than 5'6 you will have to sit sideways on the toilet or you wont fit because it buts up to the wall. Then as i was getting the pull out bed ready for my son, i seen rodent poop under the cusions. I proceeded to pull it out and found more rodent poop in the bedding. I had to wash all bedding so my son wasnt sleeping in rodent poop and pee. Then as i was stripping the bed i also found other people hair.

Pluses: Clean property and safe location. Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers. No salt & pepper, cooking oil, cooking oil spray, no recycling bin, no waste baskets In laundry room and bedrooms, slippery tub with no tub mat, only seating in living room area is an uncomfortable couch. Property is listed as sleeping 6 but only seating for 4 inside. Too small for 6. Instead of spending $$ on a sofa bed and an inflatable bed on lanai & a karaoke machine, they should provide more basics.

Pluses: Clean property and safe location. Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers. No salt & pepper, cooking oil, cooking oil spray, no recycling bin, no waste baskets In laundry room and bedrooms, slippery tub with no tub mat, only seating in living room area is an uncomfortable couch. Property is listed as sleeping 6 but only seating for 4 inside. Too small for 6. Instead of spending $$ on a sofa bed and an inflatable bed on lanai & a karaoke machine, they should provide more basics.
