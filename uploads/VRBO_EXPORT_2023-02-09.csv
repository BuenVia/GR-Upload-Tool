Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat.",Electrical - Power Outage

Beds were very comfortable, but there was only one thick/firm style of pillow that will not work for stomach sleepers.
Pool or ocean are both a 5 minute walk away. And you are in walking distance to a few different restaurants. Twisted Lime was my personal fave. Just make sure you aren't starving before you get to the restaurant as service is quite a bit slower than we are used to in Canada. 
NOTE: Bon Vivants cafe and cocktail bar is directly below the primary bedroom. If you are an early to bed person, this would be an issue due to the late-night noise. However, we didnt understand hurricane doors - you have to pull the handle up to make the door shut properly. We didn't figure this out until midstay, which lessened the noise.
We went with our two children, 10 and 12, and felt quite safe. 
You can take the #10 bus to downtown Nassau. Route goes along the coast and is about a 20 minute ride. Bus can be caught anywhere on the side of the main road by flagging them down. And when you want to get off, just say ""bus stop"". Fare is $1.50 per person. NOTE: Do NOT take the #10A is this route winds inland and takes significantly longer. Cabs were more expensive than we were expecting, and they charge additional for more than two people ($50 to downtown one way for 5 people).

It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain.

So we went to beach that day. If u rent a Jeep from st Thomas and ferry over on car barge. Make sure u get on same company going back. There are more than one. And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves.

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax.

On check out, host told me to message her directly on WhatsApp to reserve instead of the platform, a clear violation of VRBO’s rules and regulations. She then bombarded us with unwanted messages and solicitations afterwards. 

She also told us the 2 people before us mentioned they also had no direction where to put any trash either. And that they take care of it and laundry, when I told her we washed towels. Clean ones were in the dryer and ones that need to be washed were in the washer. This did not need to be done by us, but was done anyways.

The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be.

- I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room (all over sofa). I immediately contacted owner who lives close by but instead of coming over to look, she instructed me to put pots out to collect dripping water and that a roofer would come by Monday. Monday it was fixed but she left the dirty leak collecting pots in the sink for me to clean myself. Had I been the owner, I would have left a bottle of nice wine and an apology note, not a pile of dirty pots for my renter to clean. 

- The dishwater is faulty and did not clean dishes, It would run, but the dishes were still filthy after a cycle. I am an adult and quite familiar with using dishwashers, the owner instead of coming by to see for herself decided to give me a lesson on how to work the dishwasher. Regardless, I can attest that after 5 cycles the dishes never got clean. So, I spent two weeks having to hand washing all the dirty dishes. 

- The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully, it was restored fairly quickly but no utility contact/account info was given in her inadequate ""welcome book"", so I was unable to get updates as to when the power would return. 

- The garage door is controlled by a digital lock with code but the system is funky and gave me trouble a few times. Additionally the garage is very small. The front door digital lock with code is also difficult, it seems to time out and the only thing to do is wait 15 minutes for it to reset. I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. This is a basic safety issue and for this reason alone the apartment should not be rented until it is corrected. 

- Finally, the washer and dryer are in a janky downstairs room which is very grimy. The washer/dryer is not listed in the ""welcome book"" forcing me to inquire (yet again) about their whereabouts and usage. 

- I travel and use short term rentals 6-8 times per year and this experience was pretty awful. Wendy the owner was “mostly” responsive but consistently condescending. She also offered no credit for any of the above issues. Well, she did offer to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth leaving at that point.

This MIL suite is at the lower portion of a house, with a fully separate entry. It was really good to have a level entrance with no stairs! The electric fireplace was nice, WiFi/Internet great, parking was great, and owner communication was great!

The listing said full kitchen and we used the dishes, silverware, pots and pans, tea kettle, toaster, microwave, and dishwasher. We did not use the countertop oven. I appreciated knowing that it was a small refrigerator ahead of time, as it helped in planning what to bring/not bring. The listing I believe did say a stove, which was one of the reasons I selected it. What was in the kitchen was 2 burner ceramic/glass stovetop, which even with a users manual was a bit confusing for me to use. However in communicating with the owner my questions were cleared up. It might have been helpful to have pictures of the kitchen to see what was included. 

The weather when we were there was cold for the Seattle area so we used the wall thermostat/heaters and the space heaters. However we were also cooking at the same time on the stovetop and heating water in a tea kettle and the power went out in a portion of the kitchen and some outlets. To his credit, when we contacted the owner he quickly remedied the situation.

Sigh...we booked this place for a ten night stay in Salt Lake over the Christmas and New Year holidays. We checked in on the 23rd and walked into an attic apartment with no heat. It was 28 degrees outside AND inside the place. We could literally see our breath, standing next to the bed. 

Once I discovered there was no power to the thermostat, I contacted the property manager who, up until the day of check-in, had been very communicative. He (Eddie) told me he had never heard of this problem and asked me to send him a picture of the thermostat, my name, and the address to the property where we were staying. Um, okay. I did that and he told me he would get back to me. Luckily we had family to meet and we were able to go to dinner somewhere that allowed us to keep our car running so the dogs didn't freeze. 

While we were still under the assumption that the heater would be fixed eventually, we bought a space heater at Costco ($90) and a bag of ice melt ($10) to try to remove the snow and ice that were frozen on the Excorcist-style metal staircase. Oh, a couple more fun facts - there was no lightbulb over the door at the top of the stairs and also no mat outside the door to keep from tracking everything onto the kitchen floor. 

I'm going to spare the frustrating story of my texts back and forth with Eddie about the heater not working, the neighbors trying to flip the breaker, and the property manager not being able to reach a technician because it was Christmas and just skip to the part where Eddie told me his solution was to cancel our reservation and issue a refund. Whaaaaaaat???

And so...we had no where to stay. On Christmas, with two big dogs and a truck full of the things needed to live life away from home for ten days. We ended up finding a place eventually, but had to pay another $1000+ on top of the $900 we had already paid to VRBO. 

Eddie told us on December 23rd that we would received a refund. We received it (after multiple texts and emails,) on January 5th. 

I understand this apartment is only used as a rental property. It's bare bones, which would have been fine if there had been heat. There were towels set out for us, so it looked like someone had prepared the place for our stay. Only no one had prepared. You would think if you were renting a property in the middle of winter, you would check to make sure the heater worked.

I especially enjoyed the covered deck downstairs. I was able to sit on a comfortable outdoor couch in front of a fire pit and watch my grandchildren play in the snow. 
PG&E had a power outage shortly after we arrived. When i message the owner he responded immediately and offered to drive up and start the generator for us. He also drove up 2 days before our stay to make sure the driveway and stairs were clear of snow. 
Little touches like bed trays set up ion each master bed made me feel like a special guest. I would definitely stay again.",Electrical - Power Outage

Then after we were in the property, we were locked in by the gate that was jammed, and we couldn't leave until after 11PM. Which was one whole night gone. The next day was my best friend's birthday so of course we woke up early to start the day with breakfast and some sightseeing. When we returned to change for her birthday dinner the power was out! We were told that it was a power outage for the whole aera. So, we had to reschedule our plans for her B-day being that we couldn't get ready. On Sunday we had a stopped-up toilet that was flooding, and the tub was backing up. Notified host and was told Maintenace would be over to fix it immediately. We left and started with our day stayed gone all day. We were contacted by the host around 7pm saying that they couldn't fix the bathroom until the next day, but they would give us access to another room to use the bathroom. Which I responded was crazy begin that we are two women, and you want us to leave the apartment and go to another apartment to use the bathroom. The bathroom was left a mess in our unit. I also notified the host of the bathroom being a mess. Host stated that he would see if he could move us to another unit being that he didn't know the bathroom was left a mess, but we never heard from him again that night. We were also accused of flushing baby wipes down the toilet which was the reason they said the toilet and tub was backing up. We did not flush baby wipes down any toilet. Of course, after this I reached out to VRBO Support, but they were no help, only saying they would reach out to the host letting him know my complaints and he should be in touch with me. The host was in contact with me but for my complaints just to let me know the Maintenance team would be coming to fix the problem. I asked the host if he had heard from VRBO Support, but he said he didn't know what I was talking about. The issues were fixed in time for my best friend and I to go to her re-planned birthday dinner on our last night in Houston.

As far as the “frat room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!!

I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food.

Comments from a couple of the other guests:
“… the house was absolutely fabulous — well-appointed and perfectly on theme. Rob was by far the most helpful and responsive property manager I’ve ever worked with. When advised the first morning that the master bath toilet wasn’t usable, he sent Christian over right away. Christian had it repaired and the bathroom cleaned within 2 hours. Great, friendly service!”
“Outstanding customer service. Very responsive to any issues, including going above and beyond during a local power outage to ensure we were ok and even brought lanterns. 
Location is quiet, yet still close to downtown and local attractions. 
Décor and usability of the home is excellent. Well-appointed kitchen. Practical yet stylish furnishing. LP collection is so FUN!

The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around.

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property.

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable.

This was the ""Penthouse end unit"" I rented. I had the misconception that it meant a larger wrap around deck which it didn't. I arrived to the unit at 5 pm only to find the parking lot covered in the most disgusting mud I have ever seen. About a third of the parking lot was so deeply covered in mud you couldn't park so the rest of the spaces in the lot were always taken. I found a narrow slit to park in and slipped and slid all the way to the entrance. I ruined my new shoes as were covered in mud. This was from rains that occurred earlier in the week. The streams pouring on to the street and into the ocean there were carrying the mud from the mountainside and putting it everywhere including the beach and water which was now the color of my morning coffee. The unit itself is a well used rental and looks the part. The television in the living room was watchable but never managed to figure how to stream as I believe it wasn't connected to the wifi. The bedroom tv was postage stamp size which I never turned on. The unit had most everything there but just all basic and nothing one would consider luxury. Furniture was well used and just left the impression of minimal amounts to get the job done. The coup d' etat was that we were told to move our cars to clean the parking lot. The problem is there is nowhere to park your car off property and it was a half mile round trip for me to park my car and then I was stuck in the mud in the process. Totally uncalled for. The worst part was I sent a note to the manager explaining my displeasure but was told basically, mahalo. On top of that, when we finally decided to try the television after dinner to watch something the power went out for 2.5 hours. The best part was the beach to the south was most interesting and a great place to watch sea life and the sunset. When you check in they require you to get a parking pass and such. The problem is they are only open from 9 am to 2pm which is difficult since you can't check in until 3 pm. The last straw was it was unit 601 which is directly on the street of Kihei blvd and so the noise was ungodly. I never, ever would have rented a unit like this in that location but you don't know. The view was even compromised and the picture they use is from the one angle you could actually see the water decently.

It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone.",Electrical - Power Outage

The tv in the bedroom did not work initially. The garage door is funky and gave me trouble a few times and is VERY small. The front door punch code is also a pain in the ass and I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. Not ok and not safe. Additionally, the washer and dryer are in a janky room downstairs and very grimy. It also isn’t listed in her welcome book and I needed to inquire about their whereabouts and usage. I travel a ton and this experience was fairly awful. Wendy the owner was “mainly” responsive but super condescending and in no way offered any kick back due to my issues.

More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous.

The kitchen is advertised as well stocked, but they didn’t have basic things such as regular salt and pepper, measuring cups, or serving utensils. There’s no dishwasher, which is fine, but the dish soap provided had been watered down to be essentially useless and even that was almost empty. The fridge had spilled condiments in it that looked really old. A smoke alarm in the main bedroom wasn’t connected. There was also almost no room to park and this area wasn’t marked, so getting settled was stressful and the owners had to text us to explain things. The weirdest part of all of this is that the owners live maybe 100 yards from the place, so it’s wild that so many little things were just not taken care of and clearly hadn’t been in a long time. I also had a question prior to the stay and reached out to the property manager on VRBO and never heard anything back even after reaching out three times.

Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out. Ping pong table net is hanging on by a thread, and one of the fooz ball players is broken. Lastly, the advertising was slightly misleading as we thought this was a house. It is a duplex, connected with one other building. Not a huge problem, but we prefer a detached home when it's advertised as a house.

Sharon Wright, of issues with the condo and here are only some: second king bed was actually 4 twin mattress placed on king frame and they wouldn't stay together, we was told this was not the way it should be and they ordered a new mattress but that did not show up until exactly 1 week after our arrival. The tv in that same bedroom did not work and they got a new one & brought it after a week . The Hurricaine shutter over master bedroom screen patio was hanging halfway down and was broken and was never repaired for the 26 nights we were there. I believe this is a fire code hazard as it blocked our escape if we couldn't go out the main door. The heat did not work and wasn't repaired. The second bathroom shower leaked water ( a lot of water) everytime it was used, again not repaired. We were short on towels & wash clothes & extra linens were not provided. Advertised beach chairs but only had 2 bag chairs. Sharon did get us 3 towels & wash cloths and 2 more bag chairs, not beach chairs as advertised but that took 6 days.

Ontop of these fees if you want housekeeping to clean your room then that's ANOTHER $80 DAILY fee!! This listing & owner is UNETHICAL by charging ALL of these EXTRA fees!! You might think that you're getting a deal at $135 night for a ""beach front"" condo which by the way isnt even ""beach front"" its several miles away from the beach. Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!! You're better off renting a room at the Hilton or Marriot for $250-$275 at least that includes: housekeeping, parking, breakfast, clean towels, toliet paper, pools that dont close until 11pm, etc. The place was dirty too!! The first night I checked in I found feces on my bathroom towels!! Yes HUMAN POOP!!! There was also mold on the towels & on walls in the bathroom!! The floors were so dirty that they turned my feet BLACK!! If I can post pics I will!! The appliances are so difficult to work & understand because they're targeted to foreigners!! The stove & diahwasher just has symbols & knobs goodluck trying to figure out how to use them with NO instructions!! Three days into my stay the fire alarm goes off in the building awakening me out of a deep sleep that almost gave me a heart attack!! Everyone was forced to evaluate the whole building for almost 1hr!! This is what I paid $275 a night for? Day# 5 into my stay I'm sleeping & hear someone trying to enter my room mid morning? Luckily, I had the deadbolt locked & the extra lock mechanism. I most certainly heard several beeps coming from the door as if someone was trying to ENTER my room while I was sleeping!! Talk about SHADY ASF!! Day #6 into my stay I receive a knock at the front door around noon. I'm a professional poker player so I'm out playing poker tournaments until 6am in the morning I just got back to the room & finally fell asleep around 7am-8am. I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""?

Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub. You can definitely find a more comfortable stay elsewhere with better management. Save yourself the headache of booking here.",Fire

It would seem that she is very busy lady with a lot of responsibilities, and not much time to dedicate to this vacation rental, or the needs of it's tenants. Eighteen friends and I have a yearly retreat, and our former lodging, a home in Heber was sold. This place seemed perfect for us, and it even had a hot tub, and beds for 21. Only we found out when we got there that there were only beds for 17, and the hot tub was broken. And things went downhill from there. The kitchen electrical circuit kept flipping off, and we learned that to use the microwave, we had to unplug everything else in the kitchen, including the stove. Also, a bedroom and the only bathroom in the basement had zero working outlets. When I texted Corinn about the electrical issues, she said no one had ever had issues like that before, so it followed that we could not be having those issues. When we checked the reviews, we saw that others had complained about the electrical issues. She did own that the hot tub was awaiting a part, and apologized. We all showed up with bathing suits-- such a disappointment! Then around 9 pm, a city water main broke, leaving us with no running water, no flushing toilets, until about 2:00 the next afternoon. So we spent several hours gathering snow in large bowls and melting it, oh so tediously, on the stove, a process that resumed again for several hours in the morning.
I reached out to Corinn the night of the water crisis and she said she would bring us drinking water the next morning, only she didn't. We kept melting snow and purchased drinking water and water to wash the dishes by hand. In addition, many commonly needed items were completely lacking -- kitchen basics like dish towels and extra paper towels, sharp knives, etc. The only thing to wash the dishes with were a couple of old, worn, mildewy sponges. At least 2 upstairs smoke detectors were broken, disconnected, and stashed in dressers. The basement bedroom with no working outlets also had no nightstands or bedside lighting or rugs on the cold floor. The television remote control had dead batteries, and no extras anywhere. The basement bathroom shower and curtain were dirty, and the whole house needed a deep clean. Many issues, little concern, and not following through on offer of recompense. With some care, this place could be a peaceful sanctuary, but we will keep looking 🥺",Fire

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :). We were so appreciative. 

Thank you Jay & his concierge, for offering this wonderful lake home. We can’t wait to come back.

We stay at many VRBO's and this property was one of our worst. The issues were all communicated to the management company upon checkout and to this day, almost a month later, we have not received any type of resolution. 
 
Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard.

Otherwise we could’ve been staying the night in a hospital, or worse. Vrbo has been contacted. We reached out to the owner of the property about this, and it was completely ignored. Instead, they responded with a canned “thank you for staying” response.
2. No smoke detectors.
3. There is an odor in the house masked by air fresheners in every room.
4. The toilet would barely flush the entirety of our 12 hour stay.

Other things would need addressing as well, but this location cannot be stayed at again without the above addressed. We hope the owner takes our review to heart before renting this property again.",Fire

The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉.

The best thing about the house was the tiki hut although the covers on the lounge chair were dry rotted and need to be replaced.

Three weeks in the pool turned green because it hadn’t been serviced and we couldn’t use it for a week while it cleared out. Although the house is in one level the floor isn’t level, not good for anyone with mobility issues. Then there is the pool table that takes up a third of the living space with a broken pool que.
The furniture is uncomfortable and sparse, no tables where you need them for for putting down a drink or book.
When the drainage pipe for the sinks and bathrooms backed up that was disgusting.
When the air conditioning stopped working on New Years Eve and it took 6 days for it ti be repaired in eighty degree weather it was anything but comfortable.

Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

House was very nice house. Could have comfortably fit a lot more people. Nice and private up on a mountain. Super close to the lake. Great views. 

Due to the weather, we came in early and to the owners credit, was cool with it. We were arriving after a very messy previous guest, which shocked me because we always leave a place cleaner than we found it. Cleaning lady had only just gotten there. We dropped our gear, changed and left but she may have felt rushed and didn’t clean master spa and shower. Found a bunch of hair and ring around the tub. We cleaned it and give her a pass as we invaded her cleaning time.

There are really only a few suggesting I would make, but important ones. I usually share these directly with the owner and leave it off the reviews but I received no response to my feedback, so rather than risk the next person having problems, I’ll list on here.

1. No snow shovels. It snowed 3-4 feet during out stay and although there was a plow, it doesn’t get up to the vehicle. Bring one if you have one.
2. Fancy espresso machine and a keurig, but no standard coffee pot. Also, no keurig inserts. I brought grinds but ended up drinking cappuccinos the entire time when I just wanted to have my normal cup of coffee.

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica.

The place was nice but the hot tub was filled with algae when we arrived and wasn’t treated for two of the four nights we were there.

When the shower knob fell out, maintenance was out within several hours which was appreciated. 

Loved the standing desk and monitor in the master so nice of you do have to work a little while on vacation. 

Like some other vacation rentals in the area, you have to LOVE stairs as there are a LOT of them. The builder who thought a metal spiral staircase to the hot tub was clearly imbibing or enjoying from the green medical signs! No doubt they were trying to take advantage of space, but it’s a weird setup. 

I would suggest the owners put in a larger tv in the main floor as watching a football playoff game on a tiny tv was a little bit of a bummer. There is a larger one on the lower floor but not much seating. 

Minus the stairs, I think I would love this place a lot more outside of the winter skiing season. The driveway was tight with the snow but we loved seeing the bikes that could be used in non-snowing seasons.",Pool Unclean Water

We picked up the cabin's key around 3:55 in the office and were told that the cabin was ready by the time we arrived. We arrived at the cabin around 4 and the person who was cleaning asked for 20 more minutes.
He did not let us unload and it was super cold so we headed to the starbucks. We came back around 4:40 and the cabin was not ready yet. 
Finally he left the cabin around 5 pm and let us in after 4 hours of driving & waiting. 
After turning on the heater we felt an unpleasant smell in one of the bedrooms on the third floor.
We opened the window, closed the door, contacted the office (5:50pm). They promised to send someone to fix it, but after exchanging messages they said they cannot send anyone till the day after. 
We rented this property just because of the number of bedrooms it has so we can have our privacy. But due to this issue two of us ended up sleeping on the sofa in the living room.
Beside this issue the hot tub was super dirty. We have also found most of the sheets with stains and many pillows without covers. I wore my jacket and preferred not to use the dirty blankets and sheets. It was very disappointing.
The day after around noon we stopped by at the office to follow up (since they send no one). The person who did not let us in on check-in day was there and he acted like all the sheets were clean and he was not aware of the hot tub issue until we showed him the photo. Then he acted like he was taking notes and he would send someone to fix the problems.
Finally around 5 pm on Saturday a maintenance team member showed up and he said he cannot fix the bad odor and hot tub shortly and promised to document the issues.
During the checkout, we mentioned again about our terrible experience and they said that someone from their refund team will contact us which they never did. So we followed up a couple times and they kept saying that someone will be in contact soon. Couple days passed and no one contacted us. We finally were able to get a hold of someone and they simply refunded us $30 for the hot tub only. We spent over 2k for this property and we just got $30 back despite the fact that we couldn't use one of the rooms at all plus dirty hot tub and sheets; very disappointing.

Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

They did provide a pack n play and kids dishes which was great. However there is not 1 single pan to be used in the oven. This house has 5 bedrooms with atleast 1 themed for children, children who typically love fries and chicken nuggets, we need a baking pan.
Also, the kitchen table and coffee table are not kid friendly. They are glass with pointy corners.

When the company came to fix it they told us it's known that cell service here is terrible.

Our host from the onset was very communicative and quick to respond. The apartment had been cleaned early and she reached out to let us know we could check in early even though we didn't ask for it so that was a nice touch, pity we weren't in town yet. 

The apartment was accurate according to the listing and nothing was not a surprise to us which is always nice.

I would say that if you are a tall person (6' 3""), like myself, I would just be a little wary as the ceilings are lower than usual apartments. The issue really wasn't the ceiling in my case, it was the door frames. I banged my head a couple of times not thinking but it was not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The bathroom was clean and had plenty of body wash, shampoo and conditioner which was nice to have. 

I would recommend the host to add aluminum foil in the apartment because one day we made frozen pizzas in the oven and as the tray provided had gaps in it we had a little bit of a crumb cleanup because it was impossible to prevent crumbs falling through. 

Parking at the property was very convenient with a caveat. Parking is in the alley way where it's super tight. With a passenger van it's a tight squeeze and you have to be super careful not to not anything. 

Overall, it was a great stay hence the 5 star rating. Thank you for a lovely stay. Would certainly recommend to anyone.",Injury

The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless.

It was mainly my husband and I who stayed here but the other rooms were used off-and-on by our adult children and grandkids. All the beds were very comfortable, and we were happy to use the portable playpen for the new baby and the toys and books for the 3-year-old.

There was no carpet and no stairs - which worked fantastic for my blind dog and my husband, who dislocated his ankle and broke his fibula shortly after arriving in Missoula. So if you are looking for an easy-to-maneuver house, this one will work great! :-)

The only suggestions for improvement is that the couch, although a perfect fit for the living room, definitely should be updated (owner said this is planned for spring), and the neighbors, while friendly, did not shovel the driveway as planned every time it snowed. In Missoula, snow tends to melt on the driveway within a couple of days anyway, but with my husband in a boot and on a scooter, he was not able to shovel the driveway himself so sometimes it was snow-packed for a few days.

It doesn't seem like whoever runs this property has actually stayed here. The mattresses are all so uncomfortable my parents rented a separate place to stay in so they could get some sleep. There weren't enough towels for eight people. There wasn't enough room for our family (8 people) to sit together in the living room. Multiple outlets don't work. Neither of the coffee makers work.

My sister called the property management company and they brought more towels and a new coffee maker. However, they never responded to my message when I sent them a photo of the bloody comforter and listed other concerns. 

My family drove nine hours to stay here. It was $2k for three nights, in addition to the separate place my parents rented, and we all couldn't wait to leave. Not how you want to spend a family vacation.

The house was lovely, nicely decorated, very clean and spacious. The location was great, we were practically in the grounds of the abbey and the views of Whitby were amazing. We had zero complaints about the inside of the property. 

I did have a fall on the pathway leading to the door of the property as a large stone bollard was placed across the pathway and as there was no outside lighting and the bollard was not highlighted in anyway the fell over it in the dark and suffered some nasty cuts and grazes, it was a shame is it happened within two hours of checking in so put a slight dampener on the break! So just be careful of that bollard if you stay. 

We were really keen to re-book this place and we even had a few friends that were interested after we showed them the pictures however we won’t book this place again due to the after contact with Home Stay who are the company that look after the property. 

I left a couple of things behind at the house and it took 4 emails and 2 phone calls over a period of two weeks to finally be told they didn’t have my items. Two items were left in the washing machine by mistake and they have claimed that nothing was handed in. I know full well that they were left so to tell me that house-keeping didn’t find anything was a blatant lie as well as being fobbed off for two weeks. The items weren’t super expensive but did cost me £50.00 to replace, as one item was a equa-fleece dog all in one suit and a pair of bamboo socks. It was just so disappointing that they clearly have some very dishonest staff who would happily help themselves to guests property, whether that was keeping it themselves or disposing of it because they couldn’t be bothered to save it for me. 

I also sent through the pictures of my injuries after the fall and I just received a ‘sorry about that and the ‘bollard was put there by the neighbour so not really our problem’ type of response - despite the bollard being on the pathway leading to the door of the property. 

Anyway, all I would say is, the house is lovely you will not be disappointed but just be very aware of the stone bollard and do not accidentally leave any items behind as you will not see them again.",Injury

If you're looking to rent somewhere that is comfortable enough to feel like someone’s vacation home, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.

The location of this rental was decent; it was very close to the Disney parks, Walmart, and within walking distance to the pool in the complex. The rental was also very clean, and reasonably accurate to the pictures in the listing. That being said, the rental itself needs some major TLC. The floors and showers squeak loudly, and the tiles outside of the children's room upstairs are cracked and broken. The springs in the large couch were broken/missing, so when you sat on it the frame of the couch dug into your legs. The beds are all extremely uncomfortable/lumpy, and the linens did not fit the beds very well, so they would come off the mattresses while we slept. The beds were so bad that my mother and stepfather ended up taking turns sleeping on an air mattress because they could not both sleep in the bed on the first level at the same time. The AC was locked at 73, and the temperature in the rental varied wildly between being extremely hot and very cold. All of the curtains were sheer so it was very difficult to sleep in as light would start coming in as soon as the sun started to rise. 

Additionally, the neighborhood the rental is in is a pain in the butt to get into; the guard gate will require that you stop and hand over the license of the driver before they will let you in (even if you are using an uber). This often resulted in a long wait if multiple people who are renting try to come in. There was also very little consistency in the check in process at the gate; sometimes we were waved through without a second glance, other times they wanted to verify in the computer that we were allowed to enter and we were stuck waiting for several minutes. We mostly used Ubers and Lyfts, and the drivers were frequently stuck at the gate waiting despite me calling ahead and letting them know to expect them. One night my husband and I came back around 1 am after a date night, and the guard gate was unmanned despite us knocking and calling, so our uber could not get into the complex. We had to get out and walk around the gate to get home, which completely defeats the purpose of having a guard gate in the first place!",Injury

I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

The grounds are kept up perfect. A leaf dare not drop and it is swept up by the hard working gardener. The chef is delightful and made us lunch and dinner every day. You chose what you want on the menu the day before. There were a few miscommunications but all in all it went nicely. There is a helper to serve and bar tend, he was sweet and took great care of our margarita needs. He even led our group on a great hike to a waterfall. One of the highlights of the trip for the grandsons. They jumped off rocks into the river. The housekeeper kept the rooms clean and tidy everyday. My group said it exceeded their expectations and loved being right on the beach and having our own grounds. The boys loved learning to boogie board in the waves and warm sea water. There are boogie boards, pool toys, a ping pong table and kayaks too. Plus they supply life jackets. I loved listening to the waves crashing every night putting me to sleep. I had the window open all night and never needed the AC. I did get bites on my legs as I did not even use a sheet. I think there is a tiny bug called No See UM's. I got bit by those last year in Puerto Vallarta too. They itch like the devil.

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.",Stairs

However, there were some details that made us wish we had just gotten a hotel. Properties like this are the epitome of the poor STR offerings that are now commonplace.

First: This property is managed by a professional company. It is weird and inconvenient that they require guests to have to first visit an offsite location during their available office hours to check-in.

Second, the amount of messages and forms we were subject to after booking was dizzying. Once we had already booked and paid on VRBO, we were forced to fill out pages of additional forms via links with extra signatures and personal information, and then fill that information again in-person during check-in. They even prompted us to install another additional app altogether just for a 2-night stay. There were house rule sheets fed to us at every turn: in the emails, forms, on printouts, on the contracts, hanging in the home. I felt unwelcome by the end of it. The point is: booking through VRBO should be the sole source of our registration info and the house rules. All this extra stuff felt very unwelcoming.

Third: the home entrance itself was difficult to access. I wish I could post a photo, because the narrow stairs leading to the front door had at least a 3-inch thick later of slippery ice on top. It was almost comical how difficult it was to walk up the steps without assistance. We had to tag-team bringing in our bags because it was so dangerous to walk up. We couldn't have dealt with the ice if we'd wanted: all they provided was a cheap plastic snow shovel that couldn't come close to busting the ice. I can't believe they didn't clear the walkway and salt the steps before admitting guests.

Fourth: the instructions call for guests to take their garbage to the dump, after charging a cleaning fee! As paying guests (and as a short-term rental host myself), I had to laugh that these people require their guests to go run errands for them around town just to go check out. These hosts are a local company -- they can go make the garbage run to the dump themselves.

They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.",Stairs

Next the bathroom while it is gorgeous definitely need to be looked at. The sink is entirely to small and there is a strange sewer smell that lingers in the bathroom. The internet was great on my devices but the TV is so old that it can't keep up with the wifi so watching anything that was streamed constantly buffered or flat out got stuck loading. Speaking of the TV half of the TV is darkened and will SOON be out. Next the lighting going down to the property is also dangerous there needs to be more closer to the door. The bamboo on steps needs to be trimmed back, I should not have to walk around it to use the stairs.

The Good : very beautiful neighborhoods. The furniture in the room was all very well crafted and clean. The studio itself was also very clean. The lighting in the apartment was very nice. The bathroom was very nice for a one person as well. Accessibility to the neighborhood were very easy and great for finding food and other things.

The guest welcome guide online was great for getting us all the info we needed for check-in and check-out. Communication with the owners was extremely quick prior to our check-in, but once we arrived it slowed down. There were too many items to note for maintenance for me to give this 5 stars. The comforter in the Elton bedroom was stained/dirty, the fan ticked and a phone in the utility closet beeped every two minutes. We also had dust and dead flies under the chairs which we cleaned up. A kitchen drawer was missing the front panel and handle, and the dining room light fixture was missing a glass globe. The bunk room is quite small, as is the black/gold bathroom. There are two steps easily seen from the kitchen down to a door leading outside, but then there's another step beyond that which we all tripped down (it's all black tile) so be careful of that. The pool and hot tub were perfect. The showers in the two larger bathrooms were great. Beds need mattress pads (only a thin sheet between you and the mattress). But the vibe and location to the beach was top notch. I communicated the items that needed to be addressed and did receive an apology and a thanks so they can address for future guests.

I reached out via message and asked questions about the hot tub. Explained we were planning a ladies night out. My request said 5. Booking said max overnight 7. Shortly after arriving I received a message about “no unregistered guest”. And “no parties” I responded with it’s just a bunch of us ladies and I told you this is what we were reserving for. I said 2 more may stay and she then said well I have to charge you an additional $20. I mean I had been there an hour. Just trying to relax. All of us 33-50 year old moms!! We work in heath care! We needed to relax! I had to pay an additional $20
Which is just outrageous for the already $411 for the night. This woman does not know how to HOST and should not be a host. Also, the dust in the place was really bad in a ton of spots, the mold in the downstairs shower window was more than I could handle and the freaking hot tub! The reason we ended up with this one smelled terrible! Like mold. The 3 women who went in first came back smelling so bad we couldn’t take it. I have text messages about it the smell still the next day. Really nasty and she just responded with “it was refilled 4 days ago and has chemicals” sure didn’t smell like any chemicals just musty mold! Even the placemats at the table smelled like mold. Bottom line is we picked this house after lots of looking because of the layout. The kitchen, the table and the living room blend together and it was nice for conversation. Pretty and comfortable. I loved the clock. The back porch was cool
With the fire and would be awesome in summer. If you plan to rent this for yourself in town for the night or maybe 2 sure anything else you should expect to be harassed for someone’s past mistakes. Oh and forced to buy the $79 insurance plan that she swears is coming back to
Me. But to me that should have been enough for
Her but no. She needs to stop hosting. I’ll try and submit our messages screenshot for those who might think I’m over reacting 🤣. We had an awesome night after the hassle and the beds are really comfortable. The downstairs room is a little weird but nice and a huge washer dryer.

There was a paddle board and two kayaks to use as well as several water toys for children and adults. We didn't use the pool due to the weather but it was kept very clean. The outdoor shower and hose was great to rinse off with. We had a housekeeper come three times for the week and he did a great job including doing the dishes.

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

The 2 Bedroom unit was larger than expected, well supplied, clean and quiet. The pool area is right outside the Living Room Lanai and noise was not at all an issue when others were using the pool and grilling area, etc...

The step down from the Dining area into to the Living Room has two 4"" steps over an distance of 8 feet wide. We found this to be a concern moving at night without lighting. so we placed one of the Dining Room chairs at the base of the steps to alert us to the steps in the dark.

I had a night cough, so we used both bedrooms and the smaller one seamed to have some type of lingering order we couldn't identify.

The grounds were beautiful and the trail to the beach areas easy to follow. Everything in the description of the property was accurate and we used the beach chairs several times. The refrigerator freezer worked well until the last day when we had to clean out the ice storage bin so fresh ice could be produced,

The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us.",Stairs

We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN

View was beautiful from the dining and living room, as well as the kitchen. The rest of the house furniture wise was a little dated but comfortable. This house is about a 2 minute drive to the ski lodge at appalachian ski mountain where our children were taking ski lessons this weekend. 

Our main issue for the house was its exterior condition. This house is located close to the top of the Appalachian mountain Ski resort which is often blowing snow, and some of that snow may blow back on the property. In addition, it had snowed a few days prior. When we arrived, the driveway was not plowed, and with the temps jumping above and below 32 degrees it quickly became very slick. We could not pull one of our cars out of the driveway as a result, and the walkway to the entrance was also covered in snow and became pretty slick (one of our members slipped on the way in). The next day one of us had to shovel and salt the driveway ourself to give a chance for our subaru to make it out. 

On top of this, the thermostat was set to 50 degrees when we arrived, and took overnight to warm up the whole house to 70. We had to keep our 2, 4, and 6 year old in their jackets the rest of the evening to keep them warm. My father in law also tried calling the number provided for the owner but never received a call back. 

When I contacted the owner via the vrbo app they indicated that it is hard to keep up with the snow at all times, and so the driveway and walkway may not be cleaned. They also said that they control the heat remotely via wifi so that perhaps there was a connection issue. 

Regardless, for folks who are making decisions in the future on where to stay, just note that these may be things that you might have to deal with after arrival during the winter season. Had we known that we would have to clean the driveway, we would have saved the expense and just stayed in a hotel.",Accommodation

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen.",Accommodation

I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

The hosts were 5 star hosts who no one would give a bad review. It makes you feel bad about noting imperfections about your experience with this apartment. 

During cold weather like we experienced, I would give the place a 3 out of 5. Our first night, we were freezing inside. This building observes the laws about maximum heat levels. That means the heat can stay on for a certain number of hours in the morning and evening so there is no heat while you sleep. Also there is a maximum temperature the thermostat should never exceed. It was literally freezing outside and there were definitely drafts. If I knew this before going, I would have booked elsewhere. Hotels and Airbnb's that I have been to prior do not enforce these rules. Anyhow, the next morning, the apartment became warmer when our host allowed the heat to be on continuously when we were home and they provided a space heater for the back bathroom which was the coldest area in the apartment. I only wish they noticed how cold it was and got permission for continuous heat from the beginning. 

Besides this, the apartment had a number other problems which are common for lower cost places. Shower doors which don't slide well, a leaky faucet, poor bathroom ventilation, chipping paint / mold in the bathroom etc. For anyone sleeping on the sofa beds in the front of the apartment, there will be significant night noise. But you don't hear that noise in the 2 bedrooms. 

Bottomline, if you want a GREAT location and a cheap accommodation, this is a fine choice. If you can easily afford better, I would choose somewhere else, especially if it is cold outside. For those considering this apartment in the hot summer, I wouldn't worry as much in early summer. I imagine that the place is a bit like a cave which will remain cool in the heat for quite awhile.",Accommodation

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, note it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children under 6.

Also for the high cost for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests. We have also provided more details to the owners direct to ensure a positive guest experience and with some amends are sure the home will continue to improve in its standards.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water.

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children.

However, for the high cost of $6,000 for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again.

Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers.

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard

Beautiful view of lagoon, and Large Iguana sunning in tree just outside the patio enclosure!

The Good: Lots of room to spread out; gorgeous upstairs bathroom/tub/ shower; beds were SUPER comfy; washer dryer newer and worked great: came stocked with lots of spices and starter coffee and filters (may have been left by previous occupants); third floor patio furniture nicely padded; private. VERY CLEAN! 

Property Highlights: The clean pool, the jetty you could walk out to see sunrise/ sunsets, plenty of outdoor seating in and out of the sun. Lagoon is full of beautiful fish and lobster. Bought a snorkel mask at Walgreens (a short bike ride away). Clean, friendly Security at Gatehouse and Grounds Staff do a great job keeping things garbage free and tidy.

The “However…”s BIG THiNG: (Condo itself) the ground floor level has a step up to the landing and bedroom, then you turn to go up to the main level. Coming back DOWN, turn on the landing, open door into downstairs living room and there’s a STEP DOWN that I missed twice, and my mother actually fell. It’s just a regular step down in the same color tile that needs a sign, or yellow/red tape on the ground level. I had a laundry basket in my hand so stumbled down into the room and caught myself. My mom fell down and caught herself on the pullout couch bar and we spent the day at the hospital. EASY FIX, I am writing to the owners. I just don’t want someone else’s vacation to be spent at Mariner’s (GREAT little hospital and EMS and ER staff!) I pray you don’t need it. It was 100% avoidable.

The stairs are steep and narrow. Anyone with knee/ ambulatory issues ((or big feet!) should just put up the money and go stay at the Mariner’s Club as their condos are one-floor living (and gorgeous-my sister stayed there). 

The third floor patio was missing a screened panel, but I am assuming it’s from a recent storm and on the To Do list as the gnats came out in the evening, and there was a paper wasp nest above it so anyone with a bee allergy would have been concerned. 

Tiny things: Two shower doors didn’t have plastic/rubber dams so water came out under the door which is no big deal EXCEPT when someone is more susceptible to a slipping hazard.

Property (not condo itself) The walkway lamp light was out so it made traversing the outdoor stairs from main floor patio to lagoon walkway difficult (we used cell phone light but I was still not the safest)",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!",Window

We were excited to check in and enjoy the hot tub and pool right away as we had been traveling all day and my family was looking forward to relaxing. Unfortunately when we arrived at 5 PM, the pool crew was waiting to repair a broken heater, it wasn’t ready for a few more hours and it was still cold. There are no instructions on how to control the hot tub/pool heat so I called Vacay Stay to get a tutorial and was informed that there are restrictions on the temperature settings unless we wanted to pay extra (they did offer a late checkout for the inconvenience though). Considering it was in the 40s and 50s while we were there, the swimming pool was too cold at 78° to utilize. In addition to the pool/hot tub issues the top rack of the dishwasher didn’t work so after another call a crew was sent to remove it, not fix or replace it. As a family of five, we ran out of dishes each day because we couldn’t wash them all in the now half capacity dishwasher. On top of that, there were only five forks in the entire house, which made for another headache, having to hand wash dishes after every meal (certainly a favorite vacation activity). We called Vacay Stay again and they did bring additional forks. 

There’s no local television programming available at the home so unless you have your own streaming services don’t expect to watch any tv. After a long exhausting day we were ready to call it a night, and what a long uncomfortable night it was!! The master bedroom has a king size bed with little to no support in the middle and we found ourselves rolling into a king sized hole all night long! This made for a miserable night sleep with stiff backs the next day (which fyi, a cold hot tub doesn’t really help). We again called Vacay Stay who told us that there is nothing wrong with the bed, it’s just a soft mattress. 

Aside from all of the minor issues and headaches above, the lovely touch of kitchen utensils and broken broom handles wedged into the windows for security because the locks are broken was special. The neighbors dog that didn’t stop barking for four days straight was just the added touch every guest is looking for!

We had some sun, some rain and cooler temps. We looked forward to sitting outside in the back and inside to talk and write. We were visiting another friend in our Writers' Group. We were disappointed the owners haven't kept the property up to date and many things are deteriorating. We were disappointed with Vacasa, as property managers for not doing simple repairs like attaching door knobs and keeping lights working. There were post-its noting what wasn't working! We sent this list to Vacasa of the problems:
1) The main bathroom and bedroom (by pool) smell like rotten sewage and mold. We are allergic to mold and had allergies during our stay. Those rooms are only useable when the windows are open, which is cold and a safety hazard since they are at ground level. 
2) Driveway gate entry keypad doesn’t work. Vacasa knew, but gave us a code at in person check-in and let us try. When I called Vacasa back I learned it didn't work (?!)
2B) Driveway gate entry key fob in house only will open or close once. If we wanted to open, leave the driveway, and then close the gate, the gate would not close. Gate box does not respond to the key fob on any second request.
3) Issues around the house were simply noted on post-it notes around the house, as if that made the issues ok. 
4) The only outside door that works to the backyard (two others were locked down) had this post-it: “Door handle falls off.” Once in back, it’s difficult to get back in because the handle falls off (it only needs a set screw).
5) Important inside lights do not work. Some are noted on a post-it. The main kitchen light is out. So is laundry room/back hall light, which is the only light at night to the second bathroom. The exterior driveway/breezeway light, visible from the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom, is motion detect and strobes when on, which is distracting. 
6) The listing leads one to believe that guests will have two bedrooms with two fully working bathrooms, ""perfect for two couples.” However, one bathroom is across the house. The main bathroom’s “soaker tub” is a one-person wall tub with a note on it “tub is not operational”; its plumbing and tap are closed-off.
7) The bath's retro ""features"" are rotting and deteriorating.

A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken.

There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs hotel earlier if it was allowed. They said one hour early- no problem and 2 hours yes for an hourly fee.. Since it actually came to over five racks for the 3 nights (2 days) another few bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me.

Cons:

Can confirm there are many minor issues in every room. 

Stained comforter, mildew in shower door, broken toilet paper holder, double wall windows had inner windows shut but some outer windows open. 

Fireplaces did not work.
 
Kitchen was barely supplied, no salt or pepper, gross sponges and soap container, only a few pots and pans and only 2 sheet pans total.

I know it sounds dumb but the light switches were confusing. There would be a panel with 3 switches where one is power to the switch the middle one is also power but with a dimmer and the third one was a mystery switch that did nothing. 

Dvd player seems to function until you put a dvd in. Myself and 2 others all have 4 year degrees in computer related fields and none of us could figure out the AV situation in any room. 

Outdoor space was winterized (duh) and this is onky a con because it obviously hadnt been looked after for a year or so because there was dirt build up on everything. 

The gas grill downstairs was a joke. I dont think you could fit more than 2 burgers on it and the gas wouldnt ignite even. 

Downstairs kitchen had 1 plate and a dirty knife in a drawer otherwise empty. 


It is out in the country so if you arent used to country darkness it may seem very dark. That being said the drive out there is incredibly hilly and winding with multiple blind hills where you cannot see over them until you are over during day and nighttime. And the drive into galena is 30 minutes away 



Pros: 

Decently secluded and thick walls give great privacy. 

Water pressure was awesome. 

Hot tub was clean and hot when we arrived but the floor was soaked from previous rainstorm. Also only door to hot tub from inside is through the master bedroom. (Sorry not a pro, I know) 

Lots of cups bowls and plates

Plenty of parking room 

Great view of nature from all windows

Plenty of fridge and freezer space 

Comfy couches

Lots of games 

Held heat very well and distributed heat well 

Plenty of towels/wash cloths

This property was advertised as a two bedroom. It is NOT. It is a studio apartment with a bed and a futon in the kitchen. 
Upon arrival my family and I came to a parking area and this stay is located in the back building behind a car park, a bit sketchy and uneasy feeling. Upon entry, the hallway leading to the apartment was wide open, and mailboxes were broken and smashed in. We get to our door and the lock box barely worked. Entering, everything looked ok, further settling in and checking out the space, the window was left open, dust everywhere, broken cabinets, entry way door frame broken scratched as though someone had attempted breaking in.

We pulled the bed sheets back and saw more black/dirt marks, fresh spots of blood and pubic hair. 
The bathroom photographed in these photos is not the layout of the actual bathroom we had. 
The faucet for said bathroom was also broken. Upon booking in Oct when I wrote to the host, he never got back to me. Upon arrival, it took VRBO and myself several attempts to reach the owner and they did not respond to any of my messages until after the remainder of payment was made.

We decided not to stay because of the unsanitary practices of listing and misrepresentation of the listing, and because as a guest I believe that their resolution was unsatisfactory. 
We were advised by VRBO that we could not cancel since we arrived at the location and it was up to the owner to decide whether or not they wanted to refund our money.... you can see where this is going. Even though I wanted to cancel the reservation the DAY OF arrival.

Outside furniture was dangerous and my husband was lucky not to be impaled when a plastic chair literally exploded into shards beneath him.

Enormous amount of Crockery and cutlery, mismatched glasses, two coffee machines, needs severely edited, it sleeps 3 comfortably. No need for several settings and stacks of chopping boards. Kitchen units are old and bursting at floor level, fridge was absolutely tiny and shelves fell off the door, all have hairline cracks. The owner did replace the washing machine, which was temperamental. Bathroom sliding door kept falling off the mounting. Both of us jammed our hands in the patio doors, as there’s no safety stop. Inside the house was like a fridge in winter, we had to clean mould several times and our clothes were wet in the unlined wardrobes. We bought many humidifiers. No aircon means the walls are like powder and the house manager was unable to replace the curtain pole or fix the shower properly to the wall. We lived with the curtains held up by tape for many weeks. This could be a lovely house, but it needs work. The patio area gets no winter sun, but the roof does, the furniture on the roof however needs replaced, it’s not just ugly, it’s dangerous. If it’s important, the TV only had Spanish Channels. We used our own steaming stick, which worked, but the sound quality on the TV is tinny at anything above quite. The house was clean on arrival, but inside the cupboards were grimy and some crockery sticky with grease, which j didn’t use, as there’s just far too much crockery and unnecessary stuff in a rental. I binned the toilet brush, after it was knocked over and I won’t go into detail, but I binned it and left a brand new one for the owner, it was disgusting. We needed to buy a basin, as the sink didn’t hold water. The additional blanket provided was dirty and too bulky to wash in the machine in the house, I thankfully had taken our own throws. No towels provided by the owner. If we didn’t have a dog with us, there’s no way we would have stayed in the house, not in the condition it’s in.

The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.",Window

The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.",Child

We were empathetic towards this so helped where we could. Once we had finally all settled in, she knocked and came through the house two or three times looking for them and we had to move our cars several times as they went in and out. She then left her phone in the house and all throughout the evening until 11:30pm it rang on and off waking us and our children several times until we could finally locate it and discovered whose phone it was! Our first day felt like an absolute shambles because of all this and we didn’t get to properly relax at all. We then had crappy intermittently working internet the whole trip despite us saying we relied on the internet overnight (medical reason) Cheryl’s communication around this was rubbish until the final morning when she decided to call spark and by then it was too late. And no, DVDs on offer did not fix the issue we had overnight. The kayaks are decrepit and not safe for young kids to be on so don’t bother there. And to top off our holiday, despite us being SO patient and kind towards Cheryl the entire trip, she then accuses us off breaking a wheel on a trundler we didn’t even use and is charging us an extra $845 because of this and due to sand in the house and some fingerprints on the sliding door and the couch.. We were at a BEACH house with 4 young kids - come on! I grew up with a parent who was a cleaner, that parent was staying with us. We left that house cleaner than most would have, even wiping out her fridge and only left the vacuuming and linen washing for the cleaner. There are NO instructions that say any trace of sand is banned in the beach house, I rinsed off all their togs in the sink next to the washing machine, as anyone would but I’m not the perfect mum. It’s impossible for some sand not to escape me, I did my best but to charge us over $800 for sand and fingerprints is UNREASONABLE. I saw her previous review where she accused other guests of water damage and nearly didn’t book because of it but figured it was isolated and surely we’d be all good but it seems like this is just the way the owner is, she was so angry about the fact she was out of pocket for losing her keys and so she’s now clutching at straws trying to recoup some of that loss by charging us for ridiculous things.

It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child.",Child

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly

The size was perfect for my husband and I and the views were beautiful. The HUGE drawback was the shower and the cleanliness. The shower floor looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages and there was a crack in the floor fiberglass that looked like an unsuccessful repair was made. Depending on how long it’s been like this, I’d imagine the floor beneath is compromised and a major safety concern. The cabin is in desperate need of a deep cleaning. General floor areas were clean, but there was at least a quarter inch of dust on all baseboards and some fixtures. The stove burners had cooking debris that seemed to have been there awhile. The cabin has glass covers protecting the coffee tables that were disgusting underneath and on top. They are a safety concern if you bring any children because they don’t have sticky pads to hold them in place so they slide with the slightest bump. Bathroom mirrors looked like someone had taken a wet rag to clean them. 

Positive notes: Great location to all activities. The drive to the cabin is a little intense with steep inclines, but one you drive it a time or two, you get use to it. All linens were clean. We didn’t use the whirlpool tub due to not trusting the cleanliness, but we sure enjoyed the hot tub since we knew there were chemicals in it for disinfection. The cover for the hot tub isn’t the prettiest, but serves its purpose. We had a lot of fun with the pool table and retro arcade games. Gas grill worked, but had a little trouble with the ignition here and there. I’d recommend bringing a long lighter or matches in case it’s being temperamental during your visit. Also bring a dustpan/sweeper because there’s no cleaning supplies in the cabin. 

Would we stay there again? Not sure. Cabin size and amenities were perfect, but the property management that takes care of the cabin, Aunt Bugs rentals, seem to have the same bad reviews with their other cabins they rent out.

The space worked well for us (3 adults + 1 child). The TVs have been updated to HD flat screens. Deck reconstruction is work-in-progress.

More about the smell… For the first two days, there was an overwhelming, strong, unpleasant smell of fireplace smoke throughout the entire unit. The smell hit you like a wall of upon walking in the door. It made our eyes water. The smoke would be hazardous to an infant or asthmatic. There is no central HVAC (only radiant heat) so the only option to “air it out” was to open the exterior door/windows to sub-freezing high winds. We emailed the owners and they had no meaningful solutions. The building manager eventually came and she explained the wind-chimney phenomena. The phenomena is exacerbated if the units above/below use their fireplaces, which share a common chimney. The third day, mercifully, the wind died down outside and so did the smell. Our clothes stunk when we got home. It would be helpful for the owners to provide air purifiers w/HEPA filters. It smelled like we were living in a chimney.

1) Jeffery, the online assistant on Vrbo was great at responding my questions when I had to reach out reg this rental. 
2) The house had a fenced in backyard, 4 small rooms, tile or vinyl floors, clean bathrooms and beds. 
3) Despite the fact that when you lookup the address on google maps, the first thing you see is several police cars and armed officers fully crashing on the house across the street… the neighborhood was quite and pleasing in person; only heard 9 gunshots coming from a house nearby, the night before we left. Side note, it was NOT on 4th of July or New Year’s, in case you wonder. 

Now, the negatives:
1) We did not receive any communication, confirmation email, property address or check-in instruction till WE reached out the night before taking off to this destination. We first tried calling the phone number provided but nobody answered and the VM was full. Then we finally got in contact with Jeff through Vrbo’s website to provide us with the info. 
2) The floors of the house were covered in a dark dust, as if you walked into an open-door restaurant in Manhattan, that stained everything that came in contact, from my dog’s paws to our luggage and anything else in between. The rugs and runners around the house were, as expected, also stained with this dark debris (or just dirty, it didn’t stop to check). I also found some sort of large bed cover inside the washer machine that smelled like cat urine (and No laundry detergent anywhere in the house). 
3) Cockroach – there were several juvenile live roaches found crawling around the bathtubs, laundry room, inside the dishwasher! We had to sleep with all the lights on to try to avoid waking up with roaches on the bed. To their defense, there were cracks between the ceilings and the walls, all around the house; understandably hard to keep pests out. 
4) The backyard did not have a volleyball net, but only a deflated ball around the bushes. There were pieces of glass and other debris that made the yard unsuitable/unsafe to let your pet (or other children) loose. Multiple areas with dog feces around the yard from previous residents. Only 1 garbage bag, no replacement bags, which did not help... 
5) Lastly, the guest bathroom had a small leak coming from the back of the toilet, that we noted only after we tried to flush the toilet. Needless to say, we had to close the outlet valve leading to the tank and mark that bathroom out-of-order.",Child

It was an anniversary getaway. So, I trusted that it would be a good experience. The unit that we were in had some major hiccups. But overall, it was a good weekend and a good getaway. If I stay there again, it won't be in Seahorse 2-B unless the major issues are fixed! It was a comedy of errors!

The issues: 
1. Inadequate heating. 
this was a major issue, in that the gas fireplace stopped working on our second night. The gas fireplace was the only source of heat for the large living room area. The property manager (who is stellar and the major reason why I didn't give this review a low rating!) came out after 9:30 p.m. at night, after I had been communicating with Vacasa for 1.5 hours with no success (I think I was talking to a robot). The property manager identified that the gas fireplace was not safe, after he had attempted to fix it (the odor of the gas was strong), and said he would bring a space heater by in the morning. We used a gas oven to heat the living room. Luckily there was a cadet heater in the bedroom, so we didn't freeze. he brought out a space heater the next day, and it served us well for the next two nights. The housekeepers and property managers were excellent in their response! I hope that they are paid well. The senior house keeper brought by extra blankets and communicated with us throughout the lack of heating. She suggested using the oven to heat the room, which turned out great! It felt like a fancy camping trip, but I had forgotten to bring any marshmallows to roast.

2. There is exposed wiring behind the refrigerator. No outlet plate cover. This is an easy fix. 
3. The outlet in the bathroom, beside the bathroom sink, is not grounded. Again, an easy fix.
4. Molding is being held together with masking tape. 
5. The IKEA dining chairs need to be repaired and tightened. They were very rickety.
6. The sofa has unstitched upholstery that needs repair. 
7. it wouldn't hurt to have calking around the windows, as we could feel the high winds. 
8. A brighter light bulb in the bathroom would be nice. 
9. Coat Hooks! There is absolutely no place to hang clothing in this unit. It would be a beautiful use of space if about 8 coat hooks were installed in the hallway. 

I'm giving a huge shoutout to Anita, Tim, and Nathan, who were stellar in their support! The property managers and housekeeping staff are amazing!",Electrical - Loose or exposed wiring

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again.",Electrical - Loose or exposed wiring

The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo.

The only negatives were mostly beyond the owners control: way too few outlets (only 2 in the kitchen and none near the counter where one might use a laptop); slippery tiles by the pool; inconsistent maid service (we found towels in the dryer, despite being there 8 nights the sheets were not changed, and we were left to fold the towels after the maid service during the week). We found the cupboards too high, by Javier acquired a step stool (gracias), and the unit could use more towel hooks in the bathrooms (an easy Home Depot fix).

All of the appliances worked really well, and the unit did not lack for any. We found music on the TV system by accessing YouTube via the Roku. We found an extension cord, which we used in the kitchen for a 3rd outlet - a great fix).

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

The view & location were excellent. There was NEVER a shortage of towels, for both bathrooms & the pool. Nice job there!
There were a few minor things that the owner should fix when you are paying $4,000+ for a week. 
The sliding pocket door leading to bathroom in master bedroom needs leveled. 
Most of the sliding doors leading to the pool deck need to be lubricated; easy for adults to slide but not seniors. 
The light in the laundry room needs a new ballast, takes forever to come on at times. The clothes dryer takes too long to dry a simple load of towels.
The AC unit in the master bedroom needs recharged/serviced. We set to 70 degrees & it never went below 73 for an entire week. 
The handle in the master bedroom sink came right off in our hands. Simple plastic piece underneath broke off. 
The other sink in the BR had cold handle faucet that wouldn't turn off. It would just spin around. So you had to have it just right for the water to stop. 
The toilet in the other bathroom leaked slowly onto the floor. 
The garage door opener worked but it wouldn't engage the door itself. In other words, we couldn't use the garage. When it was 80+ degrees, would have been nice to get the cars out of the sun. 
So all of the above were minor in nature & owner needs to address but nothing that we were so upset with that we needed a service call. It's the little things in life that we didn't stress over. But these things need to be fixed. 
Finally we come to the pool & the hot tub. When we arrived, the water level in the pool was approx. 12-15"" low. Low enough in fact that the pool would not heat because it fell below the skimmer. There were garden hoses on either side of the pool which we used to refill the water. Took a good number of hours to refill that much water and get the heater to come on. 
The hot tub was also about 8-9"" low. Since it only held 4 people, fast to refill. 
But we learned that you cannot heat the pool & the hot tub at the same time. Maybe that is how all pool heaters work, but it was a pain to heat the pool for hours, then we had to turn that off & then heat the HT.
Finally every morning we had to refill the HT. It was bone-dry. The pump would come on and shoot water everywhere. We had to refill that everyday. That was a terrible inconvenience.
Lastly, there are ungodly amount of light switches. It would be nice to label them ALL.

The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.

This was not the case - bed linen was thin and of poor quality and we were expected to have the same sheets throughout our 3 week stay as no clean ones were provided until we insisted the cleaner came and unlocked the cupboard the sheets were locked in.

The third bed listed in the description of the property a sofa sleeper/futon bed which I planned for my adult children to take turns sleeping on. We arrived at the property at 1AM on Sunday morning. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the couch and chair in the living room were neither sleeper sofas nor futons and were not big enough for a 10 year old child to sleep on much less a full grown adult! I found a phone number for the host and texted him asking if we had been given the wrong condo as I was very specific with him prior to our trip that we needed a third bed. He never once said that the 3rd bed was an air mattress that needed to be blown up after we arrived, but this is what he texted me in the wee hours of the morning after we arrived! I could not even find the mattress until the next morning as the closet where it was stored was in a bedroom where my son had already gone to bed. I found the mattress the next morning and when I blew it up the air rushed out through a giant hole in the seam! I called the host and he insisted that it was standard that the 3rd bed was an air bed...never disclosed on VRBO, much less expected when you are booking a vacation property as opposed to an Air B and B. Later that day he had Instacart drop off a new bed. The new bed needed batteries in order to use the pump provided with the bed, however the batteries were not included...stated right on the front of the box..batteries not included! Meanwhile, I filed a complaint with VRBO about the bait and switch in the property description. They finally agreed to rebook us in a different property, but only if the host cancelled our current booking! I went back and forth via text with the host insisting he cancel our booking and he refuseed. I requested he at least refund the cleaning and service fees and he still refused. He then started referring to the fourth person in our party as an ""extra guest"". I booked and paid for 4 adults and specifically requested accommodation with 3 beds. I was never once told the third bed would be an old air mattress with a giant hole in it!

The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here.",Electrical - Faulty Equipment

We enjoyed our 10 day stay. Fish Market across the street with fresh caught fish daily. Food truck court just down the street was fun. Other small eateries and coffee shops within walking distance. Grass area with beach chairs/lounges with the waves pounding the wall in front of you. The unit's location to beachfront is hard to beat.
However, here are some observations about the condo. 
The photographer did an amazing job of making the unit look twice the size it actually is. 
Balcony and living areas are comfortable and spacious compared to the rest of the unit.
Bathroom area with shower is small but adequate for two people, not more. 
Kitchen is very small but has a full size range and microwave. No oven, but we didn't go there to make Thanksgiving dinner! Small toaster oven is provided but would not fit even a small pizza. Cooking utensils were minimal. Not many drinking glasses, especially plastic ones for the beach.
Bedroom featured a king-size captain's bed that filled the room. If you are shorter than 6 feet tall or have trouble climbing and jumping you might have trouble getting into the bed. My wife is 5 feet tall and I had to pull her into bed each night. It is comfortable once you are in it, but hard to get into. Very little room to move around the bed. We had to move a couple of items out of the room to make it easier to get around the bed. Closet is adequate size with hangers and shelves, and the captain's bed has large drawers that pull out for storing items, but they are hard to access because of how close the bed is to the walls.
Laundry facilities were easy to use and located on all levels except the first level.
Getting to the small beach in front of the break wall was difficult due to damaged stairways on both ends of the property. The damage, likely from storms, is bad enough that the stairs are fenced off. Access to the beach is by climbing down the 4-5 foot wall made of lava rock, not something everyone will be able to do. A short walk north along the street takes you to a nice public access beach where you can spend the day or just walk back through the tidepools to the front of the Paki Maui property.
Pool area was nicely outfitted with gas grills. Spa was warm and comfortable. Pool is not heated so it was not comfortable to be in (we visited in January) unless you are from Minnesota, in which case you would probably love it!
Several maintenance items had been overlooked and we hope they are repaired for the next visitor (all reported to property manager). Bathroom sink drained painfully slow. Kitchen faucet was wobbly and not properly attached to the counter top. Microwave control buttons for lights/fan were loose and hard to operate. Towel rack inside shower had been previously broken and poorly repaired requiring us to continually put it back in place.
Again, overall we enjoyed ou stay at Paki Maui but found the attention to detail for a property priced at this level to be lacking. Next visit we would choose a different property. We hope this helps those considering this unit.",Electrical - Faulty Equipment

Running inside the toilet bowl, in the kitchen sink, dozens of them running across the floors, it made me sick just thinking about them being in our food, clothes and beds! Also the first night our toilet was slow, by morning it wouldn't flush. We called Vacasa as directed and someone came within a couple of hours but was unable to fix it, he came back around 5:30 on Friday night to pick up his stuff and said he couldn't fix it and a plumber would have to come. I asked when he would be here and he said "" I don't know, it's Friday night so I don't know if he will come tonight"". He did not return that night nor the remainder of the trip, we never heard from anyone and when I sent a text message as directed I got a generic response saying no one was available at this time. We spent the remainder of the trip all having to share one bathroom. I spent an outrageous amount of money for 3 nights at the condo as a Christmas gift to my mom and daughter so that we could enjoy a special time together only to be disgusted, embarrassed and frustrated by the entire vacation. We've stayed at many VRBO type places and always had excellent experiencs, this was extremely disappointing.

Wednesday the exterminator showed up and told us that we had a bigger problem and there was a leak in the plumbing and that they were coming up the drains from the sewer. He told us what we needed to do and boil water and pour it down the drains amongst getting a plumber. Mind you this is our vacation rental and we informed him we are on vacation not our house. Later that night we got a text from the local crew that we needed to switch houses due to “the bigger issue” and we would get some level of compensation. We were moved to another house not on the beach, the pool wasn’t heated and the neighbors hated having vacationers in the neighborhood and had protest signs in their yards. Long story short we also paid for heated pool it wasn’t heated or clean and they told us to clean it. They said we would be reimbursed for the pool not being heated.

The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues. That means it is mostly an issue with the router, not the modem or the internet connection to the property itself. Although, normal router was still good for YouTube or Netflix.

The first response from the local agent when we finally managed to get her to attend the property, was “I’ve seen worse”. Not exactly what you want to hear when you’re expecting a luxury getaway.
This is a real shame as the property is in an excellent location but has been let run down.
Quality control by the local agent leaves much to be desired.

Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people

We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak!

Finding the dingy was not to hard. We got the motor fired up, loaded up the dingy & took the first load out to the boat. That took a little time to find but once you find it it was pretty easy. On our way back to shore the motor died, out of gas. Luckily it died at shore. We texted Isidora. She respond quickly & came out filled up the dingy with gas & we were on our way. Though this time the motor was not responding like it was when we first arrived. The main reason that we decided to stay on the boat was because she offered dingy & two kayaks that we could explore the mangroves with. But the motors not working correctly. Besides that the first night wasn't bad. The next day we get up & head into town to get some fishing gear & breakfast. That morning the motor was a pain to start. So I text her to try & get the motor fixed or to have the spare motor put on the dingy. She said her mechanic will be there around 12 or 1 to fix it. So we spend the morning buying fishing gear, having breakfast & exploring Key Largo. At 2, I reach out to her & she says that it should be good to go. We get back to the dingy it starts right up & we start taking off. To only have the motor die half way out to the boat. By this point we are stating to get annoyed with everything. So we limp it back to the boat. Once again I contact her & say that dingy is not working. She then says she will get her mechanic & will bring the other motor out & swap them. Perfect right, nope. By now its 2:45pm. She said she would just meet us at the boat with the mechanic to fix it. At 4pm she says that her mechanic is no where to be found so she needed us to limp the dingy back to shore, so we do. With no mechanic in sight we had to swap out the motor. Which normally we would not have a problem with that. But after today we are just over it. We get covered in gas/oil from the leaky motor. My buddy hurt his back from carrying the motor back to the car for her. So now it's our last day, we just spend the whole day messing around with the motor. Bought all of this fishing gear & its now 5pm & we just got back on the water. Also mosquitoes ate us ALIVE. She said that she would refund us for our troubles. We thought that was a very nice gesture. Since we left I have text her multiple times inquiring about the refund & no responses. She leaves my ""texts"" on read but thats it.

Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!",Gas

Schon nach der ersten Nacht im Haus kamen unsere beiden Kinder (9 und 5 Jahre) am Morgen mit jeweils gut 100 Stichen an Armen, Beinen und im Gesicht aus ihrem Zimmer. Sie sahen einfach nur schlimm aus! Wir hielten es zunächst für Mückenstiche, doch aufgrund der heftigen Attacke, des quälenden Juckreizes und nach weiteren Recherchen waren wir sicher, dass wir ein Problem mit Bettwanzen hatten. Ein Arzt bestätigte unseren Verdacht. 

Wir haben sofort unsere Vermieter vor Ort informiert und auch versucht, Belvilla zu kontaktieren, doch weder unter der benannten Telefonnummer noch per E-Mail war eine Kontaktaufnahme möglich. Auch EuroTours als genannte Agentur vor Ort war völlig uninteressiert und untätig.

Unser Ziel war es nun, so schnell wie möglich abzureisen - allerdings auch, den Import der Parasiten um jeden Preis zu verhindern! ALLES wurde gewaschen, in der Sonne getrocknet und in schwarzen Säcken wärmebehandelt - unser gesamtes Hab und Gut. Drei Tage haben wir in einer Notunterkunft geschlafen, die unser Vermieter vor Ort organisiert hat, und jeweils am Tag den Rückbau bewerkstelligt. Es war ein Albtraum!

Mit dem Kammerjäger haben wir uns am Tag der Abreise ‚die Klinke in die Hand gegeben‘. Völlig fertig haben wir unsere Rückreise angetreten - 1.400 km non stopp. Denn unsere Nachfolge-Unterkunft in Österreich, wo wir noch 4 Tage verbringen wollten, mussten wir auch stornieren.

Eine Recherche hat schnell gezeigt, dass es offensichtlich Strategie ist, nicht erreichbar zu sein. Über den Facebook Messenger (!) haben wir den Mangel angezeigt, dann erst hat Belvilla reagiert. Man sollte meinen, dass Belvilla einen sofortigen Handlungsbedarf sieht, um den Schaden zu regulieren, aber weit gefehlt! Hinhalten heißt die Strategie. Nach langem, zähen Hin und Her hat Belvilla ein ‚Kulanzangebot’ unterbreitet, das nicht mal dem Tagessatz einer Übernachtung entspricht. Alles mit der Begründung, dass wir nicht den sofortigen Kontakt gesucht hätten.

Walking into the apt there was a strange smell and the bathroom smelled worse, like dirty pipes and poor ventilation for moisture. The shower wand needs to be changed, it’s so caked up with mineral buildup and mold that the stream that you get from it, is basically drops. The linoleum tiles in the bathroom are lifting because of the moisture and there was mold in the shower.

This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.
A couple of hours later, she and another gal showed up with a new tv. They did not know how to hook it up and called a third gal from the office who came over when she could get away. She got the new tv working. I did not ask for any refund but I did ask the manager during that time if THEY offered any rebates to partially compensate for a trip as full of annoyances as this one. I just made the point that I had spent over $6000 to fly to Marco to rest and the 8 days had been anything but restful. She replied that none of this was anyone’s fault and she’d have to ask the owner about any rebate. I said thank you, please do that. As she left my unit, I reiterated, please let me know what the owner says and she said she would. I never heard another word from her.
She did also tell me that they couldn’t haul the old tv off and she would leave it and the box trash on our front porch for someone to come get. When we left 5 days later, all that trash was still setting there.

During the next 5 days, I was briefly stuck on the small elevator that goes to the upper private parking level. No call button on that elevator worked. We parked our car on the lower level and used the main elevator or the stairs. On the last day, packing to leave, we had suitcases and boxes and bags to ferry from the 4th floor to the first floor parking garage. This time my friend got stuck on the main elevator which then quit working completely. He escaped and called the Esplanade management company number posted on the elevator. That guy sounded unconcerned, yeah, we’ve been having some elevator trouble, I’ll call Otis again, blah, blah, blah. Don’t you think you should put a sign on the elevator so people will know, we asked. Oh, I’ll just cut off the circuit breaker when I get a chance to get over there, he said. (Sure hope no one was on it.) And we’re not kids but we could climb up and down 8 flights of stairs; everyone may not be able to do that.

Summary: Did we enjoy our visit? Yes of course because we don’t let stuff steal our joy and I do think our unit property folks tried at times and I also know stuff happens. But I’ve stayed at Esplanade twice before in two different units in the past few years. I loved the first two visits and can recall only experiencing one issue which was resolved satisfactorily in 10 minutes.

This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.
A couple of hours later, she and another gal showed up with a new tv. They did not know how to hook it up and called a third gal from the office who came over when she could get away. She got the new tv working. I did not ask for any refund but I did ask the manager during that time if THEY offered any rebates to partially compensate for a trip as full of annoyances as this one. I just made the point that I had spent over $6000 to fly to Marco to rest and the 8 days had been anything but restful. She replied that none of this was anyone’s fault and she’d have to ask the owner about any rebate. I said thank you, please do that. As she left my unit, I reiterated, please let me know what the owner says and she said she would. I never heard another word from her.
She did also tell me that they couldn’t haul the old tv off and she would leave it and the box trash on our front porch for someone to come get. When we left 5 days later, all that trash was still setting there.

During the next 5 days, I was briefly stuck on the small elevator that goes to the upper private parking level. No call button on that elevator worked. We parked our car on the lower level and used the main elevator or the stairs. On the last day, packing to leave, we had suitcases and boxes and bags to ferry from the 4th floor to the first floor parking garage. This time my friend got stuck on the main elevator which then quit working completely. He escaped and called the Esplanade management company number posted on the elevator. That guy sounded unconcerned, yeah, we’ve been having some elevator trouble, I’ll call Otis again, blah, blah, blah. Don’t you think you should put a sign on the elevator so people will know, we asked. Oh, I’ll just cut off the circuit breaker when I get a chance to get over there, he said. (Sure hope no one was on it.) And we’re not kids but we could climb up and down 8 flights of stairs; everyone may not be able to do that.

Summary: Did we enjoy our visit? Yes of course because we don’t let stuff steal our joy and I do think our unit property folks tried at times and I also know stuff happens. But I’ve stayed at Esplanade twice before in two different units in the past few years. I loved the first two visits and can recall only experiencing one issue which was resolved satisfactorily in 10 minutes. The property is still beautiful, the restaurants are great, and the view is just stunning.

1) If you get stuck between floors in the elevator outside of business hours, try all possible fix actions first. Then call the fire department. That emergency number that’s given to you is not a 24 hour emergency line.

2) If you want hot tub / pool heating access during your stay, communicate that ahead of time.(At least 3 days) I missed that memo and in turn missed out on the hot fun. :(

Commençons par le positif: la localisation est idéale pour visiter le Sud de l’île mais également le centre, voire le Nord si on n’a pas peur de faire un peu de route. La maison est relativement spacieuse et le voisinage tranquille (quand les chiens des voisins ne jappent pas). Cuisine quand même bien équipée mais pourrait être mieux. Par contre, il y a plusieurs importants points négatifs à mentionner. Tout d’abord, le système de plomberie est déficient ou mériterait un entretien sérieux. De fortes odeurs nauséabondes d’urine et d’excréments ont embaumé notre séjour pendant plusieurs jours. La table de la salle à manger est brisée (bois en surface pourri et endommagé) et doit être remplacée. Les matériaux (surfaces, planchers, moulures, etc.) sont endommagés à plusieurs endroits: salle d’eau, salle de bain, cuisine et chambres. Les matelas sont très durs et inconfortables. Autres points à améliorer: le drain de douche est bouché, le moustiquaire de la chambre à l’étage ne ferme pas bien, la terrasse est très endommagée, des têtes de vis sortent du bois à plusieurs endroits (très dangereux pour s’y prendre les pieds). Enfin, les communications avec l’hôte en cours de séjours ont été ardues. La gestionnaire de la propriété ne répond pas aux mails le weekend et il nous a fallu deux suivis pour qu’une action soit entreprise en lien avec le problème d’odeurs émanant de la plomberie. La ville a coupé l’eau deux soirs de suite sans que nous ayons été avisés par l’hôte, nous privant de prendre des bains et douches (y compris les enfants), ce qui était inacceptable dans les circonstances. Des avis semblaient pourtant avoir été déposés dans la boîte postale mais n’ont pas été ramassés par la gestionnaire, nous empêchant ainsi d’en être informés à l’avance et prendre des dispositions appropriées. Aussi, elle est entré dans la maison en cours de séjour alors que nous n’y étions pas, sans nous aviser au préalable. Nous trouvions important de mentionner ces divers problèmes ici car pour le prix payé (300+ euros la nuit), nous nous attentions à mieux, autant de la propriété comme telle que de l’hôte, que nous avons trouvé peu professionnelle.

Brewers Bay is one of the least crowded bays on Tortola, and it is beautiful. As the pictures show accurately, it is right on the water... lots of toys and a nice reef to snorkel, right in front of the house. 

Things to do... 
- we rented a Suzuki Jimney - you WILL need this to access the property as the roads are sketch... we picked it up right at the ferry dock upon our arrival (Island Time Car Rentals)
- drive to the West End Ferry Dock and catch a 15 min ferry to Jost Van Dyke for 4 hours... rent a Jimney there and take the ""road less travelled"" over the top of the mountains (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!)... see the ""bubbly pool"" (don't forget your bathing suit)... on Beautiful White Bay take 5 mins to get a Painkiller at the Soggy Dollar (where it was invented) and then leave immediately and go next door to eat at Hendos (a much nicer establishment with better food)
- We ate at all the best restaurants on the Island... Best of the Best: Marche at Trellis on Beef Island - incredible Poke Bowl and Sushi Rolls! Sugar Mill Hotel - setting to die for. Dragon Fly Lounge for Lunch. French Deli for coffee / pastries / wine / rum / baguette sandwiches. Brandywine Estate - what a view!
- Drive to Beef Island and take the 20 min ferry ride one day to Virgin Gorda and the Baths... suggest eating at Marche at Trellis at 1130 - right by the ferry dock - take the 100pm to Virgin Gorda... $99 car deal gets you 2 round trip ferry tickets and a rental car for the day... 130 arrival and hit the Baths... then head to Little Dix Bay around 430 (Rosewood Resort) and rinse off in their outdoor beach shower, change into a sundress and polo with light slacks and loafers (no sandals allowed!) have a drink at the RUM Bar, and dine at 6PM at the Reef Restaurant at the resort... then take the 8PM (5 mins away) ferry back to Tortola. Little Dix Bay resort is amazing and worth a visit - grab a bike at the visitor's parking lot!
- Rent a boat (with or without a skipper) at Island Time an take the 20 min ride to The Indians for the best snorkeling in the VBI

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room.

Our socks were black from the carpet and floors, trash was in the closets when we checked in, lots of trash in the garage, light bulbs out and not a lot of kitchen tools to cook things. What was disappointing was the heater stopped working during the night, which that night it got down to 20 degrees outside and the basement temperature was 63. For a child who just barely turned one that is a dangerous temperature to sleep in. Finally after the horrible management communication we were receiving a guy came out to look at the heater. He said it was clogged from something living in the house, maybe a mouse, bird something clogged the furnace, but he got the heater fixed after that. That next night while watching a movie in the theater we caught on camera a mouse in the kitchen. This is extremely dangerous with a child who is crawling and putting things in their mouth.

No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds.

While spacious with a good open main room and private picturesque setting, it was dirty and unhygienic, had insufficient cooling in the bedrooms, and a serious rat infestation. 
(Normally we give an owner a chance to fix any issues with direct, non-public feedback. This time we made a different decision to be public, to ensure accountability)

When we first arrived there were rat droppings in the living area, the kitchen and the bedrooms. Not sure how this got through “cleaning” as there were both fresh droppings and many that had clearly been there for quite some time. The rats came into the house every evening and left fresh droppings even though we left out no food. The rats repeatedly kept people awake with the noises as they knocked over and chewed non-food items. One evening when one bedroom door was closed the rats visibly chewed the carpets to get out of the bedroom under the doors. There were many unaddressed rat entry points as the ground level flyscreens were all chewed through (when we first arrived we opened the windows at night because there no was working air-conditioning in the bedrooms). After using the BBQ one evening the rats very quickly appeared on the BBQ itself before we had finished our meal (in daylight) – this was the only time that we saw the quite large rats. The owner had known about the rats before we arrived as he warned us about not leaving food out on our arrival day.

The place also had dust in many places including dust that brushed off curtains. There were stained and uncovered doonas, stinky blankets, active cobwebs and dead bugs throughout the living areas and bathrooms. The bathroom needed to be swept of bugs on arrival. Windows were dirty and smeared. This is a build up that the owners haven't bothered to deal with. One evening a cocoon/nest fell from the living room rafters onto the lounge. 

At least two bathroom doors would not latch and just blew open with a gentle breeze or with the rush of air as someone walked past.

A mother and child were stung by wasps, since – as we discovered - there was a large nest in a plant just outside the living room door on the deck. We later discovered another nest near the front door.

One air conditioning unit was broken and the “evaporative air conditioning” for the bedrooms was a complete waste of time.",Pest Control - Mice

There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but we paid almost $800/night!",Pest Control - Mice
