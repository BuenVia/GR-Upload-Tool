The power went out once during our seven day stay
TITLE: 
spectacular view and all the comforts of home
REVIEW: 
The steep trip up the mountain in our rented 4x4 was worth it as we found ourselves in a luxurious and comfy home with likely one of the most spectacular views in the area of Ojochal. Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat.

Location of the home was wonderful. It fit our needs. The power went out the first night we were there but Roger the property manager brought us up a cooler to put our food in until the power was turned back on which was very well appreciated. I do wish that there was some type of a fireplace access inside the home, but there was a small gas fire pit outside which was lovely and we enjoyed it every day.

love this house!
REVIEW: 
They did SUCH a great job with this house. It’s so well decorated and READY for guests - you’ll see what I mean when you stay. Everything is labeled with directions and it truly seems like they thought of everything. 

Only issue we had was the power went out and with young kids we were nervous about it getting too cold and their milk/food spoiling. Apparently this is an issue in this area bc we heard the neighbors generator turn on immediately. Unfortunately, the generator for this house was being installed on the Monday after we left, so we didn’t have that luxury, but future renters will have backup. :) We “survived” the power outage just fine as it was restored within a couple hours. 

The kitchen is a bit smaller than it looks in photos. just a heads up that it could get a little tight in there, especially for bigger people. 

Also, the 3rd bedroom is really a loft in the upstairs office and there’s a metal spiral staircase going up. We thought this would be where my 5yo would sleep until we saw the spiral staircase. That made us nervous if he got scared or woke up in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was an air mattress with all the necessary linens that he could use instead. The loft might be ideal for kids, but probably better for older kids (middle school to college-aged, IMO). The ceiling is slanted and I don’t know if you could stand straight up there to be honest. 

All in all, it was a great place to stay. We felt comfortable in the home, it was a great location, and we’d definitely stay here again.

winter on moody beach.
REVIEW: 
We spent a week at the beach in January in our second visit to this beautiful home. There are not a lot of stores or restaurants open but it is wonderful to be at the seashore at that time of year. However, winter in Maine can be tricky. We experienced a snow/ice storm which resulted in an area-wide power outage. The house has a Generac backup generator which did not turn on when the power went off. We contacted Olivia who immediately contacted an electrician and boiler repairman. We felt lucky that these very busy tradesmen were able to come over soon and remedy the problem, particularly since much of the area remained out of power for up to several days. Putting that experience behind us, we enjoyed a very peaceful stay and are grateful to Olivia for her prompt efforts to help us. We would not hesitate to stay here again.

tropical paradise !
REVIEW: 
We used Nacho for Airport transfer from SJO. We would recommend that for those that have never driven in Costa Rica before. We rented a car from Uvita the next day. The roads are steep and curvy but very passable in dry season. The villa is better than the pictures can capture. We were mostly here to see the jungle and birds, wildlife etc. We were pleased with what all there is to see right from the deck. We had monkeys on the deck rail 2 out of the 7 days! Toucans, Aracaris, Tanagers, Honeycreepers, and many more other species daily. The gardener showed a sloth and its baby to us one day in a tree beside the parking area. So cool! Very friendly and helpful service personnel were there upon our arrival. We had power outages every day, but it was only out for 1 or 2 minutes a day. However, I think a back-up generator was being installed while we were there. We had a problem with the pool but Nacho and Lucie were very quick to remedy that even on a weekend. If you are looking for 1st class location and villa this will not disappoint. We would book this again without hesitation if we have the opportunity. Thank you, Lucie and Cameron, for sharing your piece of paradise with our family.

REVIEW: 
We cannot say enough about how wonderfully both the owner and the local property manager handled things during our stay during the recent “atmospheric cyclone” in Northern California. The first night, 1:29 am, to be exact, all power went out in the entire Bodega Bay area due to fallen trees and branches. The owner and manager gave us directions immediately about emergency supplies and we really appreciated the wall-outlet flashlights that lit up immediately when the power failed, We were able to light the gas stove with matches, so we had tea while we enjoyed the storm. The propane fireplace worked, as well, so we were warm and cozy. The next morning, Erika called to see how we were doing and asked the local rep to bring new flashlights and a butane lighter for the stove, The power was out for 22 hours, but we enjoyed every minute. The rest of the week was rainy, and Erika texted us each day to see how we were doing. Beds were comfy, the kitchen perfectly provisioned and the views both peaceful and spectacular, We shall return for retreats as often as possible,

REVIEW: 
This unit's bedroom is right beside TWO noisy elevators. The building is old so these are two very noisy clunky elevators. I bought ear plugs to ""survive"" my 5 night stay. The power for the TV, Internet, and Fridge all went out on my 4th day. Turns out that the breaker panel is in the hallway - I ended up resetting the breakers myself - but it's crazy to have a breaker panel that any tenant could meddle with in an open hallway. On my last day there I was given a new code to open the main entrance door to the building. The explanation to use the new code was totally inadequate - I ended up standing out in the cold for 10 minutes at 12:45 am while trying to figure out how to get into the building. I ended up having to WAKE UP the superintendent to get into the building. Not a happy experience. The unit had a nice clean bathroom, the bed was comfortable and the kitchen had ""barely adequate utensils which were all very old and very well used. I would not trust Tanor to rent me any of his other units - this was overall a very annoying and unsatisfactory experience.

REVIEW: 
We ran into a couple issues the first day due to a city-wide power outage as the generator didn't kick in right away. Property manager was very responsive and helped us work through everything. I cannot express enough how great the property manager was!
Beds were very comfortable, but there was only one thick/firm style of pillow that will not work for stomach sleepers.
Pool or ocean are both a 5 minute walk away. And you are in walking distance to a few different restaurants. Twisted Lime was my personal fave. Just make sure you aren't starving before you get to the restaurant as service is quite a bit slower than we are used to in Canada. 
NOTE: Bon Vivants cafe and cocktail bar is directly below the primary bedroom. If you are an early to bed person, this would be an issue due to the late-night noise. However, we didnt understand hurricane doors - you have to pull the handle up to make the door shut properly. We didn't figure this out until midstay, which lessened the noise.
We went with our two children, 10 and 12, and felt quite safe. 
You can take the #10 bus to downtown Nassau. Route goes along the coast and is about a 20 minute ride. Bus can be caught anywhere on the side of the main road by flagging them down. And when you want to get off, just say ""bus stop"". Fare is $1.50 per person. NOTE: Do NOT take the #10A is this route winds inland and takes significantly longer. Cabs were more expensive than we were expecting, and they charge additional for more than two people ($50 to downtown one way for 5 people).
Overall, a really great place to stay, but everything was significantly more expensive than we were expecting in the Bahamas.

bad management/communication, unclean unit and power outages
REVIEW: 
This was of the WORST experience I have ever had through VRBO. Check in details were lacking, which resulted in me not getting into my unit until very late in the night, and once I did get in, I discovered the unit had not been cleaned since the last guest stayed there and there were also no sheets on the bed. This was very disappointing and frustrating given that I had been traveling and working all day and was exhausted by the time I got to the unit and then had to sit on the phone for several hours with VRBO reps trying to get the mess sorted out. On top of all that, the power went out the next evening while I was trying to get ready for a dinner party and had to use the flashlight on my cell phone in order to shower and get dressed, which was quite difficult. It's a shame that this was not better managed because the location and surrounding community were great.

TITLE: 
best location on the cliff
REVIEW: 
Property was a bit worn from comparison with the pictures. The property description proclaimed there were lounge chairs on the balcony overlooking the sea, when in actuality there were 4 plastic, hard, upright chairs that were not at all conducive to relaxation & a half-broken wooden table to place your drink on! We would have liked to spend more time on the balcony, but the chairs were too uncomfortable. The balcony handrails were all rusted and needed repair, while the neighboring condo rails were in great shape. We were allowed in early to enjoy the pool/beach, as the cleaning lady knew she had to work well after 5PM to make it right for us from the mess left behind from the previous renter. She was super! There were dirty dishes left in the dishwasher undone, & a frying pan with food still attached was found in the oven. We had to clean all the utensils, pots, & dishes that we wanted to use before we could use them. There was minimal TV service, & were told upon check-in that we would have to have our own subscription to Hulu, or Netflix etc, which we don""t subscribe to. This needs to be addressed in the description of the property for those without subscriptions, as internet service was our only access to outside news - when it was working. The screen on the bedroom sliding glass door to the balcony was trashed, so we could not open it for the lovely breeze that is available in the evening & also for air when the power went out!- which may have been a blessing since there were 2 stray cats that took up residence on our 1st floor balcony during the night. The master bath shower area is cave-like & really needed a power vent to remove the moisture, but that was broken. The stove top is barely working, as the touch pad is so worn it is difficult to adjust the temperature & to turn on & off. The paint on the ceiling is peeling off in the common kitchen area, & the refrigerator water/ice machine with the filter is inop so no potable water. The condo has the absolute BEST location in the entire complex with direct access to the pools & the beach is just steps away. Good parking is available close to the front door & is by gated access only with guard 24/7. This poor condo needs some TLC and it would be absolutely awesome!! We enjoyed St Maarten and this building location gives easy driving access to both the French & Dutch side restaurants, and the airport, while providing a very peaceful & restful atmosphere. Just needs a little TLC!

TITLE: 
nice property when you have electricity & water...
REVIEW: 
My family and I stayed at this property over Christmas. It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain. 

Would I recommend this property? IF the electricity is working, I would rate it a 4. If you stay here, pray that the electricity does not go out!

REVIEW: 
Place was awesome view. We will miss it. Just enough space for two. We elected to have joy meet us to show us how to get there. She was big help. The pool is salt and not heated. Was bummed about that. Spacious deck for both sun and shade. We were there for two weeks. Only had one day that electricity went out. Place has back up generator. But when electric goes out whole island so does wifi. So we went to beach that day. If u rent a Jeep from st Thomas and ferry over on car barge. Make sure u get on same company going back. There are more than one. And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves. For Some may be challenging or others fun. Gas / hot deli / grocery store mid way from Cruze bay to coral bay is good. We did a lot of driving around and packed a lunch. We had a great time and would go back. AWESOME VIEW.

TITLE: 
nice view and bedding - poor water/power/wi-fi and rocky beach
REVIEW: 
Some pros and cons:

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean

REVIEW: 
The house is so large we ended up using only the second floor. Decorated eclecticly, we were constantly coming across little interesting pieces and flourishes. I won't spoil it for you. One of our favorite spots was a private dining deck open to the bay. We ate most meals there. The private beach access made entering the bay effortless and if you take a short walk along the beach before sunset you can lay on the beach and watch it sink into the Caribbean. If you're a sunrise person the Atlantic beaches are a short distance away. Also our gratitude to Mr and Mrs Williams the caretakers who greeted us on arrival answered our many questions and helped with any issues. They were efficient, friendly and genuinely great people. We had a great time and felt very comfortable. Highly recommend and are planning to return. Another plus is that the house has a generator as do their other properties, so power outages won't infringe on your good time. I could go on, but as others have said it's a very special place. Lastly we would like to thank our hosts Barbara and Luciano for being so caring and helpful. We should have stayed longer.

REVIEW: 
The power was not on the first couple of hours. Messaged the host but did not hear back. Eventually it came on. We arrived in the middle of the afternoon, weather was great, so not sure why there was no power.

There was not any shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, extra garbage bags (only 1 provided) nor directions where to put trash. There were hairs in the bedsheets. Host never emailed the wifi info beforehand as the platform clearly said should have been done, and we only get it several hours later after asking. 

On check out, host told me to message her directly on WhatsApp to reserve instead of the platform, a clear violation of VRBO’s rules and regulations. She then bombarded us with unwanted messages and solicitations afterwards. 

She also told us the 2 people before us mentioned they also had no direction where to put any trash either. And that they take care of it and laundry, when I told her we washed towels. Clean ones were in the dryer and ones that need to be washed were in the washer. This did not need to be done by us, but was done anyways. Despite this, host sent a picture of little pieces of unneeded papers afterwards. 

There was also a non disclosed video camera recording the unit which is also another huge violation of VRBO’s policies.

Inside home was nice, with a nice garden, however no view of the pool as listed in the description. 
 
TV in extra bedroom did not work properly, and cut out every 10 seconds to a black screen for 10 seconds. 

Host also tried to trick us into in earlier check out time than what was listed in the VRBO. Luckily I had a screen shot of the correct check out time. But, I should not have had to go through that. Host also asked us our arrival time at least 3-4 times beforehand even though we had already sent that info each time it was asked. Perhaps the messages in the platform are not read by the host.

TITLE: 
a few issues (some possibly minor and one major)
REVIEW: 
The inside of the property was as pictured. The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be. 

Finally the biggest concern is that the owners tried to charge us several hundred dollars after the fact for deep cleaning based on ""smoking"" inside the house. None of the family are smokers and so this was definitely not the case.

TITLE: 
don't let the photos fool you. beware
REVIEW: 
Listing photos look amazing and lots of things appear “pretty” but I had major issues from the moment I arrived until the moment I left. 

- I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room (all over sofa). I immediately contacted owner who lives close by but instead of coming over to look, she instructed me to put pots out to collect dripping water and that a roofer would come by Monday. Monday it was fixed but she left the dirty leak collecting pots in the sink for me to clean myself. Had I been the owner, I would have left a bottle of nice wine and an apology note, not a pile of dirty pots for my renter to clean. 

- The dishwater is faulty and did not clean dishes, It would run, but the dishes were still filthy after a cycle. I am an adult and quite familiar with using dishwashers, the owner instead of coming by to see for herself decided to give me a lesson on how to work the dishwasher. Regardless, I can attest that after 5 cycles the dishes never got clean. So, I spent two weeks having to hand washing all the dirty dishes. 

- The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully, it was restored fairly quickly but no utility contact/account info was given in her inadequate ""welcome book"", so I was unable to get updates as to when the power would return. 

- The garage door is controlled by a digital lock with code but the system is funky and gave me trouble a few times. Additionally the garage is very small. The front door digital lock with code is also difficult, it seems to time out and the only thing to do is wait 15 minutes for it to reset. I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. This is a basic safety issue and for this reason alone the apartment should not be rented until it is corrected. 

- Finally, the washer and dryer are in a janky downstairs room which is very grimy. The washer/dryer is not listed in the ""welcome book"" forcing me to inquire (yet again) about their whereabouts and usage. 

- I travel and use short term rentals 6-8 times per year and this experience was pretty awful. Wendy the owner was “mostly” responsive but consistently condescending. She also offered no credit for any of the above issues. Well, she did offer to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth leaving at that point.

TITLE: 
globalement bon séjour avec un bémol
REVIEW: 
Jolie petite maison en RDC avec une petite cour. La maison est bien rénovée et bien située. Elle est à 5 mn du carrefour market et 10 mn à pieds du port. Le quartier est assez calme et l’on se gare dans la rue devant la maison. Par contre pas de pression d’eau et pas d’eau chaude exepté un peu le soir. Attention sur l’annonce il est indiqué 2 toilettes mais un seul fonctionne et il est dans la salle de bain. L’autre est condamné. Nous avions choisi cette location pour avoir deux toilettes et avons donc été très déçus à l’arrivée. La plaque de cuisson comporte 2 feux gaz et 2 électrique. Dommage que le gaz ne fonctionne pas car le soir il y a des coupures d’électricité. J’espère que la propriétaire va résoudre le problème de toilette ou modifier la description de son logement.

REVIEW: 
Worked out fine. Unfortunately Oregon experienced a few power outages during my stay. So power was out for 15 or so hours. Nothing to do with the property. But the apartment held it's heat well so it was not uncomfortable.

All things you need for a short stay is in the apartment.

disappointed
REVIEW: 
The house was as described.
For those booking with Vrbo in Sea Ranch, make sure your property management is VACASA not Grand Welcome.
We had the temps in the house drop to 41 degrees during the night due to the power outage and Grand Welcome was completely incommunicado. We placed 14 phone calls to them during our entire stay (Jan 3-Jan 7) and visited their office in Gualala, where the lights were on but the doors were locked.
They finally responded on Jan 19 to inform us that if we had any issues, they would have had to receive notice within 24 hours after leaving the premise.
Bad business. SMH

TITLE: 
do not stay here, very deplorable conditions
REVIEW: 
We tried to cancel before our arrival by calling Vrbo as we were worried about staying due to the very very cold and rude texts we received the day before checkin. We were very nice and courteous but this man has ZERO personality nor hosting skills. Vrbo called him he see if we could cancel due to our expressed fear (expressed to Vrbo representative) of staying at this property, she contacted him but he refused to refund our money and so did Vrbo even after expressing great concern for safety. We reluctantly decided to stay due to already paying. The “host” met us in the driveway and right off the bat after showing me where to park yelled at me when I tried pulling up in the driveway because he felt he needed to watch me park as to not hit the mailbox. Once taken to the door he opened it, told us to take our shoes off as his wife had just “vacuumed “ the bright pink carpet 30yr old dirty carpet, took us up to the “room” in which looked like we were in a converted attic and we actually laughed the 2 days we were there as if we had a 1st college studio this would have been it!! Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300! We should have trusted our gut instinct as we knew before even getting to the property something was off with this “host” and sure enough. He admitted to listening to us in our room in a text. We rent regularly and have had wonderful experiences with all other hosts. Very sad. I hope Vrbo does inspections.

TITLE: 
seattle area stay
REVIEW: 
This is a good place to go if you have trips into the Seattle area but want to come back to a cozy, more relaxing setting. This MIL suite is at the lower portion of a house, with a fully separate entry. It was really good to have a level entrance with no stairs! The electric fireplace was nice, WiFi/Internet great, parking was great, and owner communication was great!

The listing said full kitchen and we used the dishes, silverware, pots and pans, tea kettle, toaster, microwave, and dishwasher. We did not use the countertop oven. I appreciated knowing that it was a small refrigerator ahead of time, as it helped in planning what to bring/not bring. The listing I believe did say a stove, which was one of the reasons I selected it. What was in the kitchen was 2 burner ceramic/glass stovetop, which even with a users manual was a bit confusing for me to use. However in communicating with the owner my questions were cleared up. It might have been helpful to have pictures of the kitchen to see what was included. 

The weather when we were there was cold for the Seattle area so we used the wall thermostat/heaters and the space heaters. However we were also cooking at the same time on the stovetop and heating water in a tea kettle and the power went out in a portion of the kitchen and some outlets. To his credit, when we contacted the owner he quickly remedied the situation. 

We did not use the sunroom, but did enjoy the view of the creek, chickens, garden outside, and evergreen trees.

worst vrbo experience ever
REVIEW: 
On the morning of our first night in the home, the power went out. We had no power, heat or hot water. Property Manager was unable to confirm when it would be back on. We went and got food, heat etc until I watched the PGE website and saw the power appeared on in the afternoon. Drove back out to the property and the power was out. Property Manager came by, apologized and said I would be compensated. We left and went back home. I had paid for 3 nights but got one. I was only reimbursed $550 out of the $1400 I paid. I was told by the PM well the power came on at 4pm before the last night. As if we were going to go to a hotel and wait around for the power and pay for 2 locations. PGE website said the power was not coming back on until 10pm our last night so went back home. I have screenshots of the PGE website but the Vacasa LLC will not return my calls, VRBO said they would have them reach out to me but they never did. I have used VRBO for years and NEVER had this issue. This rental is the worst one out there. Be sure to check out all the fees. We paid for a hot tub we couldn't even use. It's ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere! We thought visiting our college town renting a beach house for a birthday celebration would be amazing. It was not.

be aware!
REVIEW: 
We love River Strand and this unit is in a good location. However, be aware that this is a typical rental unit, with basic amenities, most of which were in working order. The carpets and lanai furniture require cleaning. A lot of the cookware is warped, so less efficient on the glass cooktop.
However the biggest issue was that the power went out one day. It took 5 hours of calling the property manager to figure out that the owner hadn't paid the electric bill of $233 and 2 more hours before the power was restored. Who does that to their tenant?
The price is also a bit steep, compared to the prices quoted by other renters.
So be aware of these issues before you book.

great cabin and even better hosts!!!
REVIEW: 
The cabin was perfect: easy to get to, easy to park (which is sometimes hard in Munds Park b/c a lot of the driveways are on a hill) and very comfortable. 

This was my kids first time in the snow and boy did they get their fill - we had a huge snowstorm while we were at the cabin. While that was great for snowball fights it made it tough when power went out in the whole community. Travis and Heather were GREAT in helping get me out - the snowplow had created a huge wall of ice that they helped dig me out of and got me on the road safely.

Definitely plan to rent the cabin again - just hopefully not with 4 feet of snow next time. 

Highly recommended!!!

very nice, but also beware
REVIEW: 
It is a lovely place tucked away in a private setting. We really enjoyed being there for a couple of days and would have loved to have been there for the rest of the week. Unfortunately, storms resulted in power loss for more than 30 hours, and after experiencing a full day of no hot tub, no laundry, no fridge, no oven, no hot water, etc., we had to make other plans because there was no indication the power would be restored any time soon. We left 1 1/2 days early.

There were instructions in the manual provided about what to do in the event of a power outage, but I am surprised that there is not a generator on the property if power loss is a regular occurrence. We did receive a partial refund (even though the contract does state that the owners are not liable for power loss, among other things), which we did appreciate. But unfortunately what we hoped to be a great week turned into a great couple of days, followed by a frustrating couple of days. Again, it is a lovely place, but maybe make sure you stay somewhere in the area that has a generator.

freezing cold house
REVIEW: 
We have a group of people (10) and we was expecting some livable conditions at the property, where we can relax and warm up after skiing/snowboarding. 
Check in was at 4 pm. However, property was absolutely not ready. It was less than 60 degree inside and it went up to 62 by 9 pm. Management was saying that it’s normal for this house. But, after checking the description of the property, I was able to convince management to save us from freezing. One of the associates was more helpful, she brought some heaters around 10 pm.
Right after she left, electricity went off in a few bedrooms and few bathrooms. Heaters was no option anymore for some people… Management couldn’t help us. After several calls, they was able to offer me “call next day to check on you”. Guess what? Nobody called! Also, they provided info about the breaker for electricity later. 
This is not it. Be ready for cold shower if you have more than 4 people in the house taking shower same day. Boiler is capable to preheat only 5 portions of water for shower. It’s not in the description also btw.
Property wasn’t absolutely clean. Very dusty. They will ask you ti take a trash 10 min from house (DRIVING!!) and they didn’t even provided a code to the gate. 
To summarize: I paid 6k for a house with no heat, hot water, where I have to clean shelves and take care of the trash. Nothing mentioned in the description. Useless management.

great place but false promises - hot tub doesn't work
REVIEW: 
Sadly I have to leave a poor review which mostly is directed towards the Grand Welcome Property Management Company.

First positives- place is in great condition/decor and great location, 24 on call property management was responsive during stay during power outage

Negatives- 
1) Biggest problem was advertised hot tub was NEVER useable and property managers knew this according to our conversations. I also have written texts from Grand Welcome employee stating will be compensated/reimbursed for nonuseable hot tub but this NEVER happened. I contacted Grand Welcome on VRBO website, text, phone - NO RESPONSE. I really didn't want to leave a bad review but this was poor follow through adn we had many other property options without hot tubs that we passed up for this place. 

2) when power went out no guest access to reset router (which is needed and frequent power outages though short here), so hopefully owners will move to guest accessible area for future. 
3) Not enough parking, only space for 2 cars in driveway and no additional street parking so another guest had to park in a grocery lot in town. 

Happy to take down my bad review if I get the refund for HOT TUB NOT WORKING.

REVIEW: 
Wow, so much to say about such a short stay. Sigh...we booked this place for a ten night stay in Salt Lake over the Christmas and New Year holidays. We checked in on the 23rd and walked into an attic apartment with no heat. It was 28 degrees outside AND inside the place. We could literally see our breath, standing next to the bed. 

Once I discovered there was no power to the thermostat, I contacted the property manager who, up until the day of check-in, had been very communicative. He (Eddie) told me he had never heard of this problem and asked me to send him a picture of the thermostat, my name, and the address to the property where we were staying. Um, okay. I did that and he told me he would get back to me. Luckily we had family to meet and we were able to go to dinner somewhere that allowed us to keep our car running so the dogs didn't freeze. 

While we were still under the assumption that the heater would be fixed eventually, we bought a space heater at Costco ($90) and a bag of ice melt ($10) to try to remove the snow and ice that were frozen on the Excorcist-style metal staircase. Oh, a couple more fun facts - there was no lightbulb over the door at the top of the stairs and also no mat outside the door to keep from tracking everything onto the kitchen floor. 

I'm going to spare the frustrating story of my texts back and forth with Eddie about the heater not working, the neighbors trying to flip the breaker, and the property manager not being able to reach a technician because it was Christmas and just skip to the part where Eddie told me his solution was to cancel our reservation and issue a refund. Whaaaaaaat???

And so...we had no where to stay. On Christmas, with two big dogs and a truck full of the things needed to live life away from home for ten days. We ended up finding a place eventually, but had to pay another $1000+ on top of the $900 we had already paid to VRBO. 

Eddie told us on December 23rd that we would received a refund. We received it (after multiple texts and emails,) on January 5th. 

I understand this apartment is only used as a rental property. It's bare bones, which would have been fine if there had been heat. There were towels set out for us, so it looked like someone had prepared the place for our stay. Only no one had prepared. You would think if you were renting a property in the middle of winter, you would check to make sure the heater worked. Maybe they should actually visit the property once in a while?

REVIEW: 
My family has been renting houses for our annual winter trip for many years. This home is the nicest and most well equipped that we have ever stayed in. 
It was sparkling clean and the beds were comfortable. There were plenty of linens, blankets, towels, etc… The host provided coffee and a bottle of wine and there was a spice cabinet with the basics. We did some cooking and everything that we needed was there. 
I especially enjoyed the covered deck downstairs. I was able to sit on a comfortable outdoor couch in front of a fire pit and watch my grandchildren play in the snow. 
PG&E had a power outage shortly after we arrived. When i message the owner he responded immediately and offered to drive up and start the generator for us. He also drove up 2 days before our stay to make sure the driveway and stairs were clear of snow. 
Little touches like bed trays set up ion each master bed made me feel like a special guest. I would definitely stay again.

The hosts were great but unfortunately there are a few factors that I don't agree on. They charged us almost 15 € for electric yet we were hardly in as we went out for lunch and for the day so we were quite put off with the fact that we had all the lights off etc we didn't use the washing machine tumble dryer or cooker for them to charge us that for 2 nights I'm very surprised! And I double checked and it says nothing on the listing to pay extra for electric.
It's I the bottom floor and 2nd door down from the main entrance so everytime someone walked in and out the metal door would bang. Unfortunately people had been smoking in the apartment so everything stank of smoke towels the lot! It's a shame as the owners are lovely 🙁

did not get the apartment we reserved!!! plus, other issues. i would not rent this property!
REVIEW: 
Upon our arrival to the property, we did not have the rental we reserved someone else was staying in the unit we ended up getting the blue one, which was not a real difference, but we had planned the orange. Then after we were in the property, we were locked in by the gate that was jammed, and we couldn't leave until after 11PM. Which was one whole night gone. The next day was my best friend's birthday so of course we woke up early to start the day with breakfast and some sightseeing. When we returned to change for her birthday dinner the power was out! We were told that it was a power outage for the whole aera. So, we had to reschedule our plans for her B-day being that we couldn't get ready. On Sunday we had a stopped-up toilet that was flooding, and the tub was backing up. Notified host and was told Maintenace would be over to fix it immediately. We left and started with our day stayed gone all day. We were contacted by the host around 7pm saying that they couldn't fix the bathroom until the next day, but they would give us access to another room to use the bathroom. Which I responded was crazy begin that we are two women, and you want us to leave the apartment and go to another apartment to use the bathroom. The bathroom was left a mess in our unit. I also notified the host of the bathroom being a mess. Host stated that he would see if he could move us to another unit being that he didn't know the bathroom was left a mess, but we never heard from him again that night. We were also accused of flushing baby wipes down the toilet which was the reason they said the toilet and tub was backing up. We did not flush baby wipes down any toilet. Of course, after this I reached out to VRBO Support, but they were no help, only saying they would reach out to the host letting him know my complaints and he should be in touch with me. The host was in contact with me but for my complaints just to let me know the Maintenance team would be coming to fix the problem. I asked the host if he had heard from VRBO Support, but he said he didn't know what I was talking about. The issues were fixed in time for my best friend and I to go to her re-planned birthday dinner on our last night in Houston. I would not book this property being that the host is not any help when you have problems. I understand things happen but then you have to be responsible and accountable for your property.

scammer&terrible “host” do not give this man your money he will claim lies after you leave for more
REVIEW: 
We tried to cancel before our arrival by calling Vrbo as we were worried about staying due to the very very cold and rude texts we received the day before checkin. We were very nice and courteous but this man has ZERO personality nor hosting skills. Vrbo called him he see if we could cancel due to our expressed fear (expressed to Vrbo representative) of staying at this property, she contacted him but he refused to refund our money and so did Vrbo even after expressing great concern for safety. We reluctantly decided to stay due to already paying. The “host” aka man on a power trip, met us in the driveway and right off the bat after showing me where to park yelled at me when I tried pulling up in the driveway because he felt he needed to watch me park as to not hit the mailbox. Once taken to the door he opened it, told us to take our shoes off as his wife had just “vacuumed “ the bright pink carpet 30yr old dirty carpet, took us up to the “room” in which looked like we were in a converted attic and we actually laughed the 2 days we were there as if we had a 1st college studio this would have been it!! Very very old furniture (no legs on the purple couch, all furniture obviously from garage sales) but the worst was the 30+yr old mattress covered in plastic that was soooo hard and in such bad condition I could hardly walk after getting up both mornings. As far as the “frat room” it has no tv, we were told only to use a radiator plug in heater (ice storm/schools&county closed, 20 degrees at night) due to the “expensive cost of propane that heats the home”. With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving. The 1st night we plugged in our small foreman grill which blew a breaker and we had no electricity until the “host” fixed it. We then got a message saying to unplug the heater if we needed to use other power as it would happen again….not cool. The bathroom was a nightmare!!! Now “host” is saying the 30yr old bed was broken, which is a flat lie and charging us $1300! We should have trusted our gut instinct as we knew before even getting to the property something was off with this man and sure enough, it was a scam. He admitted to listening to us in our room in a text. Creepy, liar and WILL prey on those he knows can “afford” to pay more

We faced so many challenges for this weeks wedding. The ice storm this week brought so much damage and destruction to all of central Texas. The owners of the VRBO could have easily said we can’t host you as there were so many down trees and no power. They did not. In fact they were out there cleaning up and moving limbs and trees in between the storms. They were determined to make our wedding weekend happen. They went way above and beyond by allowing us to host our rehearsal dinner at the VRBO since our wedding venue did not have power. Bex stayed in communication with me all weekend. I can’t possibly give them a high enough rating. Thank you guys so much!!! I have a happily married daughter!!!!

REVIEW: 
Check-in information was sent a month ahead of my stay. This made the check-in process a little clunky as this information was not provided closer to my stay and got overlooked. A quick call to Charlotte though and we were able to receive our check-in information on the phone. 

The condo is located right off the Corridor run. A little bit of a push to get yourself to the Gondola but easy to get to when ending for the day. 

A couple of days before our stay was over, the lighting fixtures above the dining area and kitchen went out. Charlotte was quick to respond when messaging her early in the morning and said she would get someone there soon. I wish communication was better here as while a maintenance guy was sent over to repair the light fixture, he ended up leaving me with no power at all. I had to communicate with Charlotte to get power back after the maintenance guy left for over an hr. Power was restored by the end of the day but the light fixture was not replaced with a dimmer switch but a regular flip switch. The fixtures are very bright without the dimmer in place but I was happy to have power and my stay was almost over.

difficult isolated stay
REVIEW: 
I don't even know where to start. I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

wonderful house for family
REVIEW: 
Kristen communicated with us very well and the house was great! It was a nice little sanctuary to come home to after running around all day to Snow’s BBQ and Round Top. Plenty of space for the family (and the downstairs suite was nice and private too with a separate kitchen). 

We returned the 2nd night to find there was a power issue (unrelated to house). Our hosts immediately came out to the property and made sure we were taken care of. All was resolved quickly by the power company. 

They were wonderful hosts and we would love to return again if the house is available. Thank you!

TITLE: 
great place, great host
REVIEW: 
The important things first: Jenny is an excellent host, all communication was quick and easy. The house met all our needs and the location was what we were looking for (quiet, good space, and out-of-the-way). 

Caveat: we stayed Dec-Jan, winter months, no idea what summer is like in Rockaway Beach!

This is the longest we've stayed at a single place (almost 2 months), so we were wary, it was a big gamble. But, the house was a nice surprise. Great wifi, plenty of space for those rainy days when you can't go out, better than average tools in the kitchen, and deer, ducks, egrets, more birds, visiting the pond next door (literally, outside the porch). The neighborhood was quiet, the beach is walking distance (we did that a lot, it's a great walking beach), there's hiking in the hill to the back (did that a lot too, no seems to make use of it, even though hikers are welcome, never saw anyone else there). 

We even survived the huge storm of December just fine, although things outside didn't fare as well (BBQ grill, chairs and table went flying). 64mph winds will do that! We lost power for 24 hours (we actually expected it to be longer), and Jenny had warned us it might cut out. Either we lucked out or things have gotten much better in Rockaway, but that was the only time we lost power.

As for Rockaway Beach, if you're looking for restaurants and shopping in the winter... not gonna happen! It's a typical tourist town, beholden to the summer months, so not much open. It's exactly what we expected, so no surprise. Stock up in Tillamook or visit Astoria and the Costco, you should be good to go.

If you're looking for a clean, comfortable, quiet place (in the winter, at least), with a great host, this is an excellent house.

Grand appartement, bien aménagé, belle décoration, confortable, vaste, calme et bien situé. Vaisselle plus que complète. Petite enceinte disponible pour diffuser de la musique. 
Les bémols :
-Manquaient les draps pour 2 lits à notre arrivée. L'agence nous a fourni le lendemain matin. 
-salon manquant de luminosité. Éclairage trop faible + 1 grande baie vitrée condamnée.
-Chambres trop chaudes la nuit (chauffage coupé) et sans aération possible (pas de fenêtres). 
-coupures électriques en journée en raison d'une modulation de la puissance accessible
-Manque porte de séparation avec la salle de bain dans une chambre. Pas pratique pour laisser dormir et indiscrétions. 
-il faut monter un escalier d'un étage pour passer du casier à skis à l'extérieur et partir skis aux pieds.
Nous avons néanmoins passé un excellent séjour et beaucoup apprécié l'appartement ainsi que la station. Les points positifs sont bien plus nombreux que les bémols.

TITLE: 
great house but has issues
REVIEW: 
We came on a Friday night and everything was lovely. The door wasn’t locked (the deadbolt seemed like it hasn’t properly engaged). The beds were very creeky but comfortable. We woke up and made breakfast and then the power went out. We ate breakfast and then found the breaker box and flipped the breakers. The lights came back on. We thought everything was good after that but then we went to wash the dishes from our breakfast and the water wasn’t working. We contacted the company, bought a few gallons of water so that we could flush the toilets, and then went to the beach. The beach is not a short path away. It is a rather long road down several streets. We kept asking people we passed where the path was and they laughed and said we were better off driving. When we came back from the beach we started to make lunch and realized that even though the lights were on, the oven hadn’t come back on. So we went out to lunch. When we came back from lunch we put the babies down for a nap. We adjusted the heaters in the rooms and found out that the heaters weren’t working (neither the cadets in the wall or the ductless system that was lighting up like it was on but no air was coming out). We really wanted to stay and did enjoy our first night there, but we couldn’t figure out why the water, oven and heaters weren’t working. At that point we decided to end our trip early and go home to make sure it was safe for our babies who we were worried about getting too cold without heat. After we packed everything up, my husband checked that the door was locked and the door handle came off.

worst experience ever
REVIEW: 
My wife and I booked this place for our honeymoon as it looked extremely promising. When we arrived the place was dirty, hair all over the couch/food stains and sticky counter tops. The master bathroom smelled like sewage. We contacted mauricio and asked him if our suite had even been cleaned before our arrival and this is just the beginning. I tried to contact the host before our arrival for the check in process and he literally didn’t answer back until 20 mins before check in. On day three the power went out, there was no electricity running water or working toilets, I know it’s out of their control but he did absolutely nothing to help us figure out what to do in this situation. It was 120 degrees in the apartment and stuffy and dark and the security gate no longer worked. We ended up packing our stuff and walking to the hotel in town in the dark. Day two no power and still no help from Mauricio. At that point we went back packed all of our stuff and left for good. The first two days my wife had really bad allergies and we couldn’t figure out why until Mauricio sent me pictures of the couch and accused us of bringing a dog even though I had messaged him immediately when we got there and questioned if they had even cleaned the place, given her allergies we tried to stay out of the Vrbo as much as possible since it seemed like that’s the only place they were triggered. My wife is deathly allergic to dogs and there was dog hair all over the couch behind the pillows. Good luck getting a refund from these people or Vrbo. Our honeymoon was ruined and was also slightly dangerous given we had to figure out what to do walking around in the dark in a cartel ridden town no thanks to Mauricio. STAY AWAY FROM VRBO AND ARBA.

Stay away. Booked this for a ski trip with family. Drove from Seattle only to find there was no place to park due to snow, property had no electricity. It was unsafe to stay with kids overnight. Couldn't contact property manager multiple calls going to vm which was full so couldnt leave message. We turned back after trying for an hr. Host finally messaged he will refund but still havent gotten the money back in 1 month. I am out almost $1000. Vrbo customer service is non existent too. Left a complaint with no response yet. The property is a metal container that has been converted. There is no bathroom to wash, only a very dirty porta potty! The listing is inaccurate. Stay away!! Will give negative 5 stars. Waste of money. I plan to stay away from VRBO. We book cabins every few months - this has been the worst experience in years.

Great experience from beginning to end; making the reservation, pre-trip communication & on stie support all the way through check out. Property even better than expected. Well appointed. Location great; near downtown & airport in historic neighborhood. Great to have 3 bedrooms and casita with 2 beds for the five of us. Pool, hot tub, sauna, and fire pit all awesome. Care put into the furnishings. Property clean and organized.
Rob provided high level customer service/white glove concierge attention. Thanks, Rob.
Comments from a couple of the other guests:
“… the house was absolutely fabulous — well-appointed and perfectly on theme. Rob was by far the most helpful and responsive property manager I’ve ever worked with. When advised the first morning that the master bath toilet wasn’t usable, he sent Christian over right away. Christian had it repaired and the bathroom cleaned within 2 hours. Great, friendly service!”
“Outstanding customer service. Very responsive to any issues, including going above and beyond during a local power outage to ensure we were ok and even brought lanterns. 
Location is quiet, yet still close to downtown and local attractions. 
Décor and usability of the home is excellent. Well-appointed kitchen. Practical yet stylish furnishing. LP collection is so FUN! 
Perfect space to relax and enjoy all that PS has to offer.”

perfect stay in paradise
REVIEW: 
If you’re looking for a perfect place to stay with great oceanfront views every day all day and be amongst great people in the Bahamians this is the place. There are no crowds to deal with just you, the locals and your own schedule. Cecil’s place is amazing. We like to vacation at our own pace while having the views we’ve come to love being at oceanfront. We don’t like the crowds and the tourism side of things so this was perfect for us. 
If you consider staying here read the amenities abs details more than once. This is not a fully laid out Airbnb but it is perfect if you’re looking to vacation at a wonderful place. 
We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcoholic or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage.

REVIEW: 
Came here for an epic bike ride that got canceled due to “bomb cyclone”. Hunkered down in this awesome property that was a few blocks from the ocean view of turbulent stormy sea! Never lost power and the house was amazing despite the gail force wind. Communication with the host was above and beyond what I expected. Had no issues with the neighborhood. Would come again and probably will!

REVIEW: 
This property reminded us our our old home in a neighboring town of Evergreen! The views were beautiful and it was private which is something important to us. We had everything we needed and the host was very helpful! The refrigerator went out as a result of a power outage, we believe, and when it didn’t come back on with the rest of the electricity, Bryan offered to bring ice and coolers to not lose food and scheduled a technician to come out ASAP. It was such a kind gesture, but we found a bag of ice and the refrigerator was back up and running the next morning when we woke up. Overall the stay was great and would recommend this house to anyone.

REVIEW: 
The condo was perfectly located on Santana Row to enjoy restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping without getting in your car! Was here visiting my daughter and could not have been more perfectly situated! Property manager, Connor was incredibly responsive as I was there during the city wide power outages and he did everything possible to make the situation as painless as possible. 
My only suggestion is to change out the pull out sofa. It was too hard to sleep on for my daughter who is used to camping and sleeping on the ground. The main bedroom had a very comfy mattress though and the living room sofa and little office setup were perfect for my working stay! Highly recommend!

cozy getaway
REVIEW: 
Linda was great! She was very communicative. She contacted us a few days in advance to provide check-in information and answer any questions we had. She also provided suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We got unlucky with the weather while we were there and were under a weather alert at one point with predicted power outages and Linda dropped off a flashlight and battery-powered lantern for us just in case. She made us feel very welcome and taken care of the entire time. 

The property itself was also very nice. It's a studio in the lower level of a little bungalow, but felt spacious and was comfortably arranged. The bathroom was a nice size (bigger than I expected) and the kitchenette was well-stocked for what we needed. We dined out a lot, but there were plates, silverware, mini fridge, microwave, and toaster oven for leftovers (plus more equipment that we didn't use). 

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property. There were lots of coffee and restaurant options within 15 minutes' driving distance (many within 5 minutes), it was 20-30 minutes to the sites we wanted to see in San Francisco, and 60-90 minutes to nature areas like Muir Woods and Point Reyes. 

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable. 

This property was nice and cozy and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Linda!

REVIEW: 
This property is so far off the main road you can’t get a taxi or Uber so you must rent an suv. An SUV is a must since the roads are all dirt and have horrible dips. They only had a little car and we got 2 flat tires from the roads. We had no running water for 16 hours during the week. Then we had no power or water the last day we were trying to pack up to leave. The sofa was pretty dirty and you didn’t want to use. The shower head has such lower water pressure it’s hard to get all the shampoo and conditioner out so, I looked like a grease head the whole time. The pool was dirty when we arrived and after 8 days it was still never cleaned. There is a canopy over the pool which has large carabiners connection which was fine until the wind blows in the night and they are banging on the the roof all night long. There was weeks worth of bird poop on the deck in which we scrubbed for a while trying to clean because you couldn’t access the door way without stepping in it.

We all were blown away by the meticulous grounds, the countless amenities, the roominess of the bedrooms and living areas, the large kitchen, the pool house... We could not have found a more perfect place to stay. The proximity to Sonoma Plaza and our chosen wineries made it an ideal location for all our plans.

REVIEW: 
The condo is completely updated, well-equipped w/everything we needed for cooking at home and spending time at the beach. During our stay we had unusual weather causing flash flooding, mud in our parking lot, and a power outage--our host and the neighbors were wonderfully helpful in looking out for us during these unexpected events. Also, after I put an ink spot on the brand new, (very comfy) pull-out couch, the host was extremely kind and reassuring in getting it removed. Always buy the insurance! Thank you, Susan, for a magical and comfortable Maui experience!

not what i signed up for
REVIEW: 
Since they asked me to review this property I shall review it exactly as I saw it and experienced it. This was the ""Penthouse end unit"" I rented. I had the misconception that it meant a larger wrap around deck which it didn't. I arrived to the unit at 5 pm only to find the parking lot covered in the most disgusting mud I have ever seen. About a third of the parking lot was so deeply covered in mud you couldn't park so the rest of the spaces in the lot were always taken. I found a narrow slit to park in and slipped and slid all the way to the entrance. I ruined my new shoes as were covered in mud. This was from rains that occurred earlier in the week. The streams pouring on to the street and into the ocean there were carrying the mud from the mountainside and putting it everywhere including the beach and water which was now the color of my morning coffee. The unit itself is a well used rental and looks the part. The television in the living room was watchable but never managed to figure how to stream as I believe it wasn't connected to the wifi. The bedroom tv was postage stamp size which I never turned on. The unit had most everything there but just all basic and nothing one would consider luxury. Furniture was well used and just left the impression of minimal amounts to get the job done. The coup d' etat was that we were told to move our cars to clean the parking lot. The problem is there is nowhere to park your car off property and it was a half mile round trip for me to park my car and then I was stuck in the mud in the process. Totally uncalled for. The worst part was I sent a note to the manager explaining my displeasure but was told basically, mahalo. On top of that, when we finally decided to try the television after dinner to watch something the power went out for 2.5 hours. The best part was the beach to the south was most interesting and a great place to watch sea life and the sunset. When you check in they require you to get a parking pass and such. The problem is they are only open from 9 am to 2pm which is difficult since you can't check in until 3 pm. The last straw was it was unit 601 which is directly on the street of Kihei blvd and so the noise was ungodly. I never, ever would have rented a unit like this in that location but you don't know. The view was even compromised and the picture they use is from the one angle you could actually see the water decently. During a zoom call I had to mute my mic due to the noise.

This is a great property and located just minutes from the Ski hill. The hot tub with a view after skiing is Awesome. The duel floors allow two couples (or couple with kids )to enjoy the place and still have privacy. The owners are very responsive to questions and issues. The garage is very tiny but my Jeep Latitude just fit. Warning! The garage can only be opened from key pad on outside of garage. If power goes out you cannot gain access to the garage or contents until power is restored. Learned that the hard way. I recommend leaving it open just enough to crawl under to manually open if you have a big ski day planned. The kitchen has all the equipment you need to cook your meals and a table for four. TV has great streaming options. The floor heat is very nice and fans are provided for. those who like white noise or a little breeze. Overall a Great place to stay!

TITLE: 
appealing apartment, the images are very deceiving.
REVIEW: 
This was quite simply the worst place we have ever stayed! we would not recommend it to anyone. It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone.

Day two we shoveled again and had to shovel the road way as well. Yes we had chains. Beautiful place, perfect for a ski weekend, if you have a snowmobile… otherwise don’t bother at all.

money pit and condescending owner
REVIEW: 
Pics looks amazing and lots of things appear “pretty” but I had MAJOR issues from the moment I arrived until the moment I left. I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room all over sofa. I immediately contacted owner who apparently lives close. Instead of coming over to look right away she instructed me to put pots out to collect water and roofer would come Monday. Monday it was fixed BUT she actually left me the pots in the sink to clean myself!! Unreal. I would have left a bottle of good wine if it was my place! The dishwater did not clean dishes adequately. I am 46 and very familiar with using dishwashers, since the owner seemed to think I needed a review, and can attest that after 5 cycles my dishes were not clean. The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully it was restored fairly quickly but no utility info was given in her shitty welcome book. The tv in the bedroom did not work initially. The garage door is funky and gave me trouble a few times and is VERY small. The front door punch code is also a pain in the ass and I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. Not ok and not safe. Additionally, the washer and dryer are in a janky room downstairs and very grimy. It also isn’t listed in her welcome book and I needed to inquire about their whereabouts and usage. I travel a ton and this experience was fairly awful. Wendy the owner was “mainly” responsive but super condescending and in no way offered any kick back due to my issues. She offered to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth me leaving at that point. I do not recommend!!!

I had to work on this vacation the wifi worked great. 

We had one minor power outage, think maybe 2 hours. We were gone that day, so that we wouldn’t have even noticed. Kev checked in, gave us an update, and told us where the flashlight was. 

Kev gave some great recommendations of things to see and do. Defiantly will stay here again.

REVIEW: 
The place is quaint, with a feeling of being in the center of the heart of the in-between downtown and campus loop. It’s quiet and the noise downstairs is not unbearable like I thought it could be (the loudest was the occasional overly drunk person yelling to friends down the street - the sound of happy college kids).

What wasn’t so charming was the rest of the stay and that was solely responsible by who was in charge of the rental (not the apartment or the people). The problem was the apathetic management. 

-We had to call for check-in instructions (usually those come via email and I received them four days after our stay.
-When we arrived, I knocked on the backdoor for someone to move their car so we could park there.
- The pipes were dry emitting sewer gas smells
- The temperature in the apartment was 50 degrees because the heat was off.
- There was no CO or smoke detector (it was laying on a TV stand with the battery out.
- We had to find our own bedding in the apartment and make our own beds
- We had to call for towels (which arrived quickly the next day)
- Trash cans were unlined and we had to find the liners
- The sink was dirty with someone else's shaved whiskers
- The ""goodies"" in the fridge didn't seem safe to eat based on how else everything was 'forgotten' about

It left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I'll eat or sleep there again. Management said they'd try and make it right, but I never heard from them again.

far from a comfortable stay
REVIEW: 
Our experience started with arriving at the unit and discovering that the code we were given opened the lock box, where there was NO key. We called the unit manager, Jessica Jimenez, who finally got back to us after 20 minutes and gave us the code to the electronic lock. The apartment looked exactly like the images, but was not maintained well. Going out to the balcony, we found a cigarette butt and moving the accent table found it was not cleaned underneath it. The primary bedroom had no closet and the second bedroom had a closet, half fitted with shelves and the other half with a tall chest of drawers leaving 8"" on hanging on either side of the chest of drawers. The kitchen cabinets were very old and dirty... seeing our first roach within minutes of arriving. Good pots and pans, but few pieces of flatware. Baths were decent, but we had to look for bath mats that were dirty, so we washed them. The washer and dryer were very good, but was concerned about the dryer filter since the screen had holes in it and lint was going into the machine..... potential fire hazard. The TV was not working and Jessica kept telling us that the remote had to be connected to the internet. After two weeks of not being able to stream, tech person Saul came to check it out and discovered that the remote was not working. Three days later he returned and hooked up a new remote and we were able to watch TV our last week. While watching TV, we discovered crumbs that had fallen between the cushions and never cleaned up. We have been using VRBO for several years and this is the first horrible experience we have had. DO NOT rent this unit.

REVIEW: 
This place was in a great location beautiful home and it was quiet clean to some standards but not to mine. There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

We enjoyed our stay here, it was a great location with close walk to the shops and not far to the beach. Excellent space for a family of 5. House was really clean and tidy, really well looked after (even if it looks a bit dated in parts in the photos - yes it is, but it’s fine and in really good condition). Beds, linen, pillows all fantastic, great condition and very comfortable. Pool table was fun and three TVs were great. Internet perfect. Smoke alarms went off once for no reason and another time just opening the oven. Not a big deal. Slight leak in kitchen skylight in heavy rain was a bit of pain but didn’t cause a significant problem. Would definitely stay here again. Best improvement to make would be a nice outdoor area to sit and relax outside, not particularly inviting and so we didn’t hang out the back at all. Again, not a big issue but would’ve made it that much better. Thanks for providing a nice place.

Beautiful and large condo with a gorgeous location right on the beach. It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.
3. This is very minor but, we could not get the toaster to work no matter how we tried

Cleanliness of the condo was definitely not the best, stuff from previous ""renters"" were still in the rooms. Lost internet for most of the stay which sucked but not much you can do about that. Smoke alarm started to beep do to low battery in the middle of the night. Very minimum things in there. Normally there is trash bags, ziploc bags, foil, salt and pepper, sugar, coffee not at this place. It literally has bare minimum in there. Bed in master is ""memory foam"" it was really hard and sheets had stains in them. Overall the only good thing for our family was the location.

REVIEW: 
This property COULD be what they claim in the listing a “luxury beach cottage” but sadly it is not. It seems the expectation is that the guest will make themselves available to pack up holiday decorations that filled closets,manage housekeeping, pool maintenance,& plumbers. Issues may arise during a stay but basic maintenance should be addressed between guests - not left for the guests to address. The house was dirty- red splatters on bedroom doors, dirty toilet seat , blankets of dust on mouldings. Red food splatters on kitchen cabinet, backsplash tile and toe kick in kitchen. Scuff marks on walls, moldy caulking in shower. Washing machine was dirty and there were dirty towels in the washing machine when we arrived. Slow sink in the bathroom. 
When I told The host that I felt the cleaning service was stealing her money she became defensive and said they do a wonderful job and that she has been using them for 5 years. 
There were Missing fire alarms. Only 2 in the bedrooms. None in the rest of the house. Broken shades in den. No information about the area attractions, restaurants, grocery store, - although the host was aware that a previous guest had taken the book there was no replacement. Extension cords that are staples to wall used to plug in lamps. 
The 4th bedroom is in the ‘guest cottage’ which would have been fine for us IF it was clean, didn’t smell musty and if people staying in there were able to access the main house at night after the doors to the house were locked. The back door to the yard from the main house didn’t close correctly so they put 2 slide bolts on it. Because of this anyone staying in the guest house would have to exit the yard and walk around to the front door to unlock it with a key. The only other access would be through a bedroom which would be awkward to leave unlocked while people are sleeping in the room. 
The pool heater not on. Had to flip on circuit breaker while being directed by host and program heater-heater not working and pool needed to be shocked .
The AC compressor in the side yard next to back door has fencing around it that is in disrepair and literally fell down every day- very disappointing Major construction going on next door- had to finally leave early bc we couldn’t sit outside from noise and debris coming over the fence. Use your money elsewhere Would not recommend. Area was centrally located to all. Find another house in the same area. You’ll be much happier.

REVIEW: 
The unit we stayed in was unsafe and we called and texted Vacasa, but no “local team” ever came out to fix the exposed wiring and electrical issues. Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again.

Really enjoyed the condo. Perfect for 2 adults. Any more would be a bit tight given the limited amount of closet space and how small the bedrooms are. My only major criticism is that for a 2 week stay it would have been nice to offer a full cleaning / laundry / sheet change at the end of one week....that would have happened in any case had I rented 2 x one week so not sure why it was not offered. 
The garage was just big enough for a standard SUV and that was a good thing as there are generally NOT enough ""visitor"" parking spots when you need them (at night). Having said that, the management company was very responsive when the smoke alarms went off in the middle of the night (annoying--a step ladder should be provided) and for other small questions.

REVIEW: 
The owner was nice enough to allow us to checkin early & out later, however upon checkin there were issues that we brought to his attention that were not addressed. #1 Fire Alarm was removed from the wall and Beeping/Chirping when we put it back in. We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice.

beautiful family retreat
REVIEW: 
This was an amazing home for our entire family. We enjoyed gathering after the days adventures around the large dining table to play games. We had a minor issue with the fire alarms but management was fast to address the issues. Was a little disappointed there wasn’t beach access any longer but we were so close to so many other gorgeous beaches. Truly enjoyed our stay!

REVIEW: 
Fabulous location right in the heart of the pedestrianised area. However, that was the only good thing about the property. 
Light switches not working properly, clothes hooks hanging off the wall, smoke alarm downstairs had been removed / battery taken out, 80 years of dust in the lamp shade (the building will be one of the original buildings in Chamonix) kitchen falling apart, broken floor tiles in the bathroom, only 1 key provided, no door mat, no handrail in the stairwell, crockery was all mismatched. 
Property is in need of significant work/upgrades to get it to the standard expected and price being charged. 
Would highly recommend the area / location but not the property.

REVIEW: 
Small, cozy space but doable with 2 teenagers. Third floor (out of 4), great view overlooking walking Main Street of the village. Fireplace wasn't working, hadn't been for a number of prior guests, but central heating worked fine. We set off the fire alarm every morning while cooking breakfast, even pancakes. Heard other alarms go off in building during meal times, so a design flaw on venting. Good location, parked car in garage under facility, never drove during our visit. Heated floors in bathroom a nice touch. Appliances are new and good quality. Laundry in condo.

The condo was unacceptably dirty. Kitchen floor was sticky, so I wiped it down with paper towels. The towels were black with dirt. The knobs of the kitchen cabinets were dirty.
The microwave, refrigerator and bathroom were clean, to give some credit.
light bulb in the kitchen was out. Toilet ran continuously, 
the shower curtain was rusty and torn. Window in the bedroom was either broken or installed improperly and the wind whipped thru it. There was a large stain on the futon. There was no smoke alarm.
I asked for and received a refund on my cleaning fee. 
This property reflects poorly on VRBO.

There is one entrance/exit; a fire hazard. The sliding door at the back is propped up with 2x4s and a sign on the door says ""this door works better."" A 3/4 inch piece of plywood was put under the couch cushions to provide stability. The couches look like something from a thrift store with unmatched cushions. Only 2 towels were provided and the kitchen was not adequate. Mismatched dishes. Furnished on the cheap. 
 Contacted the rental company, and they said ""we will bring what you need."" They never did. Washing machine sounds like a train running through the apartment. Not worth the rental price.

REVIEW: 
This condo is in a wonderful location. It is on the 12th floor, so the view afforded is terrific. ( e.g sunrise and sunsets). Also, the condo layout is excellent. But, this condo demonstrates evidence of "" wear "". For example, upon checking in, it was discovered at the freezer was leaking water. The dishwasher seemed to wiggle around each time the door was closed, and a smoke detector was missing from one of the bedrooms. Further, the shower curtain ( assoc. with the back bedroom) was disgusting....as a tremendous amount of mold had accumulated. ( we purchased some bleach and remedied this situationi) It is evident that the cleaning of this condo takes place on a ""broadbrush"" approach. We enjoyed our stay, but the condo clearly needs some handy work.

REVIEW: 
Hi Alice, I’m providing some feedback as requested. While it’s much appreciated that accommodation like the Raetihi bach is available at low cost, and a more basic standard is expected for the price, there were a few issues. The bach was quite dirty when we arrived. We’ve left it cleaner than when we arrived, but providing some cleaning products (cloths, toilet cleaner, gloves, etc) would help future people with this. More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous. In short, we think the bach needs a check and a good clean before the next people come in.

i wanted to love this place
REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stay in a rental property. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

The townhome was absolutely beautiful and exactly as described and shown in the pictures. It was the perfect location in the city and easy to get to. Beds were very comfortable. Home was well stocked with supplies and necessities except for one oversight of not having kitchen trash bags. Communication with the property manager was great.

The home is very large so there were a few areas that was overlooked when it came to cleaning and maintenance. The previous guest left a used sanitary napkin in the master closet. The towels in one of the guest rooms were still a bit damp like they just were not left in the dryer long enough. Also the smoke alarm started beeping with low battery alerts the second day, and the heat lamp on the roof did not seem to work (or we just didn’t know how to work it w/o instructions) Other than that everything else was perfect and it was the perfect birthday retreat/staycation.

Hot tub was nice and there is very nice indoor parking (but we didn't use). Overall the owner was very communicative and made the check in process very easy and straightforward.

REVIEW: 
Where to begin? When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here.

so many problems.
REVIEW: 
The best part of this property were that the beds were comfy and the view was great, especially from the hot tub! Otherwise there were a lot of annoying problems. First of all, this space is *tiny* and doesn’t have a good room for even 4 people to sit comfortably and just hang out unless you’re all cool laying in bed together or sitting on the floor. One of the chairs in the kitchen was broken when we arrived and wasn’t safe to sit on. The kitchen is advertised as well stocked, but they didn’t have basic things such as regular salt and pepper, measuring cups, or serving utensils. There’s no dishwasher, which is fine, but the dish soap provided had been watered down to be essentially useless and even that was almost empty. The fridge had spilled condiments in it that looked really old. A smoke alarm in the main bedroom wasn’t connected. There was also almost no room to park and this area wasn’t marked, so getting settled was stressful and the owners had to text us to explain things. The weirdest part of all of this is that the owners live maybe 100 yards from the place, so it’s wild that so many little things were just not taken care of and clearly hadn’t been in a long time. I also had a question prior to the stay and reached out to the property manager on VRBO and never heard anything back even after reaching out three times. 

My takeaway from this admittedly cute and well-decorated place is that it is much more concerned with aesthetics than being an actually functional place to stay. We made it work but dang. I’ve never had so much go wrong.

My stay was ok, but there were several things that could have been done better. Dollar store TP and paper towels gotta go. I had to purchase my own. None of the remotes worked, had to buy batteries. Smoke detector was beeping, had to replace a 9V battery there. 

Bed was horrible, I barely slept. And the HVAC system was so loud that if I did fall asleep, it wouldn't last long. Remote work was uncomfortable because my only option was the kitchen table with non optimal chair. 

Listing said there was a fitness center. I never found it. There was a bike parked outside, I assumed it was for the property, but it had two flat tires and a rusted chain so that wasn't going to do any good.

The location was quiet and other than the upstairs neighbor having an occasional wrestling match with his dog (I'm guessing) the noise and traffic in the complex was acceptable.

For my next visit to Mesquite I will look elsewhere.

Property was decent size with plenty of beds. Kitchen was not very clean when we arrived, oven was not usable as it smoked up the whole house triggering smoke alarm, some of the dishes and utensils were not clean, floor was not swept up. Almost as someone forgot to clean the kitchen. The rest of the property was in decent shape.

Great location. Easy access to everything . Clean and comfortable. Everything in working order. During the evening of our last day we noticed the smell of wood smoke but saw no smoke or fire.

REVIEW: 
We sure do like staying at Turtle Bay! Cathy’s place was certainly familiar to us and it helped make our trip great! I’m house laundry is sooo convenient! Check in was easy. The main toilet had trouble with refilling the tank and the smoke detector battery was low which resulted in chirping. We informed her about it and she was fixing to take care of it. The bed was plenty comfy. Windows and sliders open for a nice cross breeze. The place stayed plenty cool for us to sleep at night. Kitchen could have been better stocked with spices. Sift through some of the beach amenities to make sure they function well- both umbrellas we tried to bring with us were broken. But this is all very small stuff and we had a great time regardless! Love the North Shore!

REVIEW: 
The smoke alarm beeped intermittently the entire visit. It was loud and made it impossible to sleep or even enjoy being in the unit at all. They sent someone to fix it three different times but it was never fixed. It just kept beeping. And it was loud. 
The location of the unit was convenient for the Convention Center. 
There was a lot of hallway noise and you could hear the neighbors pretty clearly. 
Communication was quick but it didn’t seem to be directly with the management company.

REVIEW: 
I'll start with positives. The beds were so comfortable; we slept so well! Location was great and easy to access. Plenty of space for sleeping , easily sleeps 10. Xbox was a hit with the kids. Hot tub was nice. 
Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out. Ping pong table net is hanging on by a thread, and one of the fooz ball players is broken. Lastly, the advertising was slightly misleading as we thought this was a house. It is a duplex, connected with one other building. Not a huge problem, but we prefer a detached home when it's advertised as a house.
Overall, a nice stay.

REVIEW: 
Several weeks before arrival I received an email that main pool & hot tub were not usable, this wouldn't have been too bad but 1 other pool ran out of propane to heat and the pool was cold and another one had a broken heater the next day so it was cold also! 
Upon arrival on a Thursday was told we had no tv and no internet until Monday but actually didn't get it until Tuesday. We took a list to the property manager. Sharon Wright, of issues with the condo and here are only some: second king bed was actually 4 twin mattress placed on king frame and they wouldn't stay together, we was told this was not the way it should be and they ordered a new mattress but that did not show up until exactly 1 week after our arrival. The tv in that same bedroom did not work and they got a new one & brought it after a week . The Hurricaine shutter over master bedroom screen patio was hanging halfway down and was broken and was never repaired for the 26 nights we were there. I believe this is a fire code hazard as it blocked our escape if we couldn't go out the main door. The heat did not work and wasn't repaired. The second bathroom shower leaked water ( a lot of water) everytime it was used, again not repaired. We were short on towels & wash clothes & extra linens were not provided. Advertised beach chairs but only had 2 bag chairs. Sharon did get us 3 towels & wash cloths and 2 more bag chairs, not beach chairs as advertised but that took 6 days. The worse part was that Sharon promised delivery of many things at certain times but didn't show up at those times or take the time to at least call to let us know. we always had to call or show up at the office to find out why we didn't get the items and when would we get them. We did not report the washer but it was in the kitchen and so loud you couldn't hear the tv. 
The condo was not clean upon arrival. I took pictures of the issues. We did negotiate a refund due to the issues but we did not get 1/2 of the amount we had asked for.
I did call VRBO on the second day and stated telling some of the issues but wasn't done & our call was dropped and it was after he had asked me if my number was a good number to call me back on if we were disconnected but he never called me back after it dropped. I seen an email that my call was finalized, which it wasn't and I replied that I wasn't finalized and would like a call back from VRBO but I didn't receive one!!!!

The main reason I wanted a condo was for the use of a kitchen. Stove top and oven would trip the breaker, the oven smoked, simple cooking would set off smoke detector, and the shower is poor quality both water pressure and broken shower head.
2C is close to the outdoor spa so you’ll hear everyone as long as their open. If you expect to go to bed early prepare for some noise. Not to mention being on the bottom floor you will hear every bit of noise from the unit above! The bed has complimentary blind folds on the bed. I think complimentary ear plugs would of been way more valuable.
If you can get past this it’s not bad though. Great to ski into and great location. Personally won’t be back.

The central location made getting to everything - from downtown to hiking at Saguaro National Park and Catalina State Park - a breeze. Well-maintained condo with a small washer/dyer combo in the unit and larger laundry facilities onsite. The fountain nearby provided peaceful white noise and a nice ambience. There was a small issue with the smoke alarm and the owner was responsive and attentive. He even met us at the unit to give a personal tour of the complex and amenities, which was an appreciated touch. We'd definitely stay here again!

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stays in an Airbnb or VBRO. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

absolute rip off!!!
REVIEW: 
So this place is NOTHING but a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! They charge you $35 DAILY ""resort fee"" which all that inlcudes is access to a rooftop pool that closes at sundown!! Then they charge you $40 DAILY parking fee!! Ontop of these fees if you want housekeeping to clean your room then that's ANOTHER $80 DAILY fee!! This listing & owner is UNETHICAL by charging ALL of these EXTRA fees!! You might think that you're getting a deal at $135 night for a ""beach front"" condo which by the way isnt even ""beach front"" its several miles away from the beach. Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!! You're better off renting a room at the Hilton or Marriot for $250-$275 at least that includes: housekeeping, parking, breakfast, clean towels, toliet paper, pools that dont close until 11pm, etc. The place was dirty too!! The first night I checked in I found feces on my bathroom towels!! Yes HUMAN POOP!!! There was also mold on the towels & on walls in the bathroom!! The floors were so dirty that they turned my feet BLACK!! If I can post pics I will!! The appliances are so difficult to work & understand because they're targeted to foreigners!! The stove & diahwasher just has symbols & knobs goodluck trying to figure out how to use them with NO instructions!! Three days into my stay the fire alarm goes off in the building awakening me out of a deep sleep that almost gave me a heart attack!! Everyone was forced to evaluate the whole building for almost 1hr!! This is what I paid $275 a night for? Day# 5 into my stay I'm sleeping & hear someone trying to enter my room mid morning? Luckily, I had the deadbolt locked & the extra lock mechanism. I most certainly heard several beeps coming from the door as if someone was trying to ENTER my room while I was sleeping!! Talk about SHADY ASF!! Day #6 into my stay I receive a knock at the front door around noon. I'm a professional poker player so I'm out playing poker tournaments until 6am in the morning I just got back to the room & finally fell asleep around 7am-8am. I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""? What a crock of BS if I've EVER heard!! You're better off finding a 4 star hotel & paying $250-$300 a night to be treated way better & NOT have to deal with a bunch of shady Mexicans trying to enter your room!!

Spend your money on a different rental for your ski weekend. During our first night were awaken by smoke detectors blaring throughout the house, and after inspecting we realized there was no threat or reason for the alarms to be going off. We were unable to disarm the alarms, and attempted several times to get in contact with Randy (for over an hour) with no response. We ended up needing to call 911 and have the fire department show up to disarm. Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub. You can definitely find a more comfortable stay elsewhere with better management. Save yourself the headache of booking here.

TITLE: 
could have been an idyllic retreat
REVIEW: 
I first want to say that I have no intent to malign or seek retribution against the homeowner, Corinn. It would seem that she is very busy lady with a lot of responsibilities, and not much time to dedicate to this vacation rental, or the needs of it's tenants. Eighteen friends and I have a yearly retreat, and our former lodging, a home in Heber was sold. This place seemed perfect for us, and it even had a hot tub, and beds for 21. Only we found out when we got there that there were only beds for 17, and the hot tub was broken. And things went downhill from there. The kitchen electrical circuit kept flipping off, and we learned that to use the microwave, we had to unplug everything else in the kitchen, including the stove. Also, a bedroom and the only bathroom in the basement had zero working outlets. When I texted Corinn about the electrical issues, she said no one had ever had issues like that before, so it followed that we could not be having those issues. When we checked the reviews, we saw that others had complained about the electrical issues. She did own that the hot tub was awaiting a part, and apologized. We all showed up with bathing suits-- such a disappointment! Then around 9 pm, a city water main broke, leaving us with no running water, no flushing toilets, until about 2:00 the next afternoon. So we spent several hours gathering snow in large bowls and melting it, oh so tediously, on the stove, a process that resumed again for several hours in the morning.
I reached out to Corinn the night of the water crisis and she said she would bring us drinking water the next morning, only she didn't. We kept melting snow and purchased drinking water and water to wash the dishes by hand. In addition, many commonly needed items were completely lacking -- kitchen basics like dish towels and extra paper towels, sharp knives, etc. The only thing to wash the dishes with were a couple of old, worn, mildewy sponges. At least 2 upstairs smoke detectors were broken, disconnected, and stashed in dressers. The basement bedroom with no working outlets also had no nightstands or bedside lighting or rugs on the cold floor. The television remote control had dead batteries, and no extras anywhere. The basement bathroom shower and curtain were dirty, and the whole house needed a deep clean. Many issues, little concern, and not following through on offer of recompense. With some care, this place could be a peaceful sanctuary, but we will keep looking 🥺

the perfect spot for a family getaway!
REVIEW: 
The location of Jays cabin home is an A+++

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :). We were so appreciative. 

Thank you Jay & his concierge, for offering this wonderful lake home. We can’t wait to come back. 

P. S. The wifi is great!

TITLE: 
unfortunately not what we had hoped...
REVIEW: 
I was very disappointed with our experience at this property. We stay at many VRBO's and this property was one of our worst. The issues were all communicated to the management company upon checkout and to this day, almost a month later, we have not received any type of resolution. 
 
Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard. The communication was subpar both locally and from Evolve. Very disappointing!

child found opioid on chair
REVIEW: 
I believe this property is a new listing and we needed a quick stay while driving through Chattanooga. There are multiple issues with this property that need addressing before anyone else considers staying here. These were the main concerns: 

1. My young 4 year old child found an opioid on one of the chairs. Luckily, my wife found it in their hand before any of our other children (ages 1-5) put it in their mouths. Otherwise we could’ve been staying the night in a hospital, or worse. Vrbo has been contacted. We reached out to the owner of the property about this, and it was completely ignored. Instead, they responded with a canned “thank you for staying” response.
2. No smoke detectors.
3. There is an odor in the house masked by air fresheners in every room.
4. The toilet would barely flush the entirety of our 12 hour stay.

Other things would need addressing as well, but this location cannot be stayed at again without the above addressed. We hope the owner takes our review to heart before renting this property again.

Upon arriving, we found a note from the host that the furnace had quit working the day before our arrival. And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving.

REVIEW: 
Always a great stay, however, it does need a few updates. Two years in a row the heat was an issue. The manager/owner fixed it, but, it was something we had to deal with. One side of the stove is not working and the other side worked half the time. Hard to bake if the oven won't stay on and the kitchen is part of the reason we stay at this house. The kitchen needs a good cleaning. With a professional stove you deal with a lot of grease and the area around the stove and the vent area needs attention. We had to fix a few chairs that had loose legs when we got there and one of the chairs at the dining room table is broken. The grill on the back porch also needs a good cleaning. When grilling or smoking it ends up firing up because of all the old grease left on it and it has a few broken parts. The last thing is the wood burning fire place, the chimney probably needs a clean out. When starting a fire you end up with a lot of smoke in the house until the fire gets really hot.

REVIEW: 
Unlike other places we have rented, there was no friendly welcome to the home. Instead, there were multiple signs telling us what not to do! 
""Heated pool"" listed in description of this house and in list of amenities. We quickly learned it was NOT heated and to heat it we would be charged an additional $80/day and it would take 3 days to warm up. Since a heated pool was one of the reasons we choose this listing, we were all extremely disappointed and felt incredibly deceived! 
The description and pictured of this house showed a large game room which added to the appeal of this home to our family. We quickly learned that this was also not as described! The golf game did not work. The video game worked on practice mode only. If you wanted to play a regular game, you needed to PAY! Next to the dart game was a bowl filled with broken darts. 
The entire house was well furnished but tired and worn. For the amount we paid in rent there was no wow. Minimal selection of glassware, cheap silverware, filthy carpeting, worn paint, missing smoke alarm, patched areas not painted. There is not enough space to explain all of our reasons for disappointment.
On a positive note, the putting green was nice and the home is in a great neighborhood.

great apartment, inaccurate location.
REVIEW: 
I rented this unit because it was a few blocks from my grandma's house. The address in the confirmation email confirmed this. Then, on the first day of the reservation, I had not received any check-in information. I contacted the property and they promptly responded, giving me a different address 4 miles away. Confused, I checked into the property. The photos were indeed the unit in the listing, but the location was very different - next door to a strip club and so close to I-85 you can hear it at all hours and watch the cars from the windows. I expressed my frustration and the manager insisted it was ""in the same area."" There was also a beeping fire alarm that was not fixed our entire 5 day reservation (I notified them the first day), and bathroom hair in the bathroom drawers (I had given up complaining at this point). Otherwise our reservation was fine, the decor is very chic and the kitchen is well-appointed, beds are very soft, spacious bathrooms, etc. I hope they've fixed the address.

Great location steps from the beach and close to the boardwalk/restaurants/shops. We had a couple issues on the first night (smoke detector chirping, thermostat not working). We called the management company who connected us with a local team member. They said they’d check on the thermostat and/or bring us space heaters that night as the house temp was 60 degrees and there were a number of small children under 3 years old in our group. Got a call back from that person saying they were no longer coming that night and they had no space heaters and local stores were closed. They said another team member would come by between 9-10am the next morning to address the issues. We waited til 10am the next morning and no one showed up. The local team member didn’t answer our calls and had no voicemail set up. Called the main Vacasa line and their staff said the ticket was entered but no ETA despite what we were previously told. Their team didn’t come til late afternoon. All they did to try to “fix” the thermostat was turn the unit on and off once. Then they left us with a few space heaters and didn’t even address the chirping smoke detector. There weren’t any extra blankets, either. Kitchen was missing a spatula, the dishwasher didn’t work, and various items were broken (e.g., towel rod). Wouldn’t recommend this home or others managed by Vacasa in the future.

REVIEW: 
We rent several times a year at various properties. In recent years you can start to feel the ""blah"" of corporate or large rental groups that is reflected in their properties. It was nice to stay at a home not just a house this time, it had thought-out amenities that make a home, it had things you didn't know you needed, until you needed them. It is risky, costly and I imagine a pain to maintain these offerings, we should all be thankful and respectful because these properties and hospitality are becoming rare. I was surprised and a little confused when the actual home owner reached out to me, an actual person, not a generated text or rental service employee. He spoke like we were old friends, which was the confusing part at first but once that was sorted out we had a great introductory conversation. Fire wood, toys, games and knives that actually cut, snow was scarce and ice was unsafe but all the extras were enough to accommodate and entertain all age groups. Thank you again -RJS

The owner was nice enough to allow us to checkin early & out later, however upon checkin there were issues that we brought to his attention that were not addressed. #1 Fire Alarm was removed from the wall and Beeping/Chirping when we put it back in. We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice. At almost three Benjamins for one night, I’d keep looking for a better spot.

We recently rented this property for a family of 7. While the property itself has many good features, presents nicely and the property managers responded quickly to problems as they arose, we were confronted with a number of concerning issues which we spent valuable holiday time dealing with quite apart from the total inconvenience of the maintenance failures eg the dishwasher failed on the first usage & leaked into the downstairs (dishwasher hose & associated electrics- rodent damage), 3 beds at least did not have fresh sheets and had sand etc in them (too late at night to involve property managers), batteries to 2 fans needed replacing and fire alarm battery needed replacing after dishwasher leak. The one upstairs toilet had a very unpleasant & obvious smell. The downstairs ensuite accommodation (a room off the converted garage) does not have an opening window in the bedroom or a fan, the nearby kitchenette could at least provided glasses for water- it is totally empty of any utensils. Not really a pleasant alternative space for grandparents!

The fire alarm was almost out of batteries as it beeped occasionally, which isn’t very safe. The steps going into the basement were extremely steep, we had a few minor accidents. Living room was spacious and clean. The bedrooms were nice too. Before booking we asked the host if the hot tub was accessible and they said yes, it was not. No water and not ready to be used. We tried filling it up the next morning with the help of one of the neighbors, he told us there might be a leak since water wouldn’t stay. Our overall stay was okay, just some minor house issues that they should maybe look into.

The good - easy to get to and check in. Lots of bedding options, towels and linen. Enjoyed the family games and staples in the pantry. Not so good - the wonderful view was blocked by vehicles parked out front, the double bed was quite uncomfortable, some TLC is needed in the property with fittings (broken and uncovered light sockets/exposed wiring) and some items fell/broke due to poor attachments to plaster (owner repaired when contacted). Couldn't see a fire alarm and the oven kept tripping the fuse box/power off when used. The owner was easy to contact on Stayz and while not living nearby, had a neighbour who was available if needed. Instructions for the use of the appliances would have been helpful, also some fishing rods or beach gear that we might borrow. Was overpriced for a shack but overall a fairly pleasant stay.

what you see isn't always what to get
REVIEW: 
We decided to leave the “Urban Oasis” early as our disappointment with it just kept growing.The first problem we had was difficulty in locating the property, as there was no visible address from the street, and it was also in a pretty questionable area of town. When we did find it, we realized that the host Kevin lived right on the property, not in the same home, but close enough that we had very little privacy. The screen in porch that is so nice in the pictures was damaged by the hurricane and had a big hole in the ceiling, and screening was damaged. Kevin told us the screen guy would be there in a couple weeks to fix it, found out, he didn’t have the money to fix it, so that wouldn’t get done. no porch light in the screen porch, it was broke, brought it to his attention, not going to get fixed. There were no locks on the sliding glass door, and the front door he couldn’t find the key, so no security when we left the building. The house was dirty when we went in, had to clean the fridge, floors,dust and disinfect before I could feel comfortable staying , there was even a pizza pan with pizza on it in the oven! Kevin did come in 2 weeks later and asked if we wanted it cleaned! no smokes alarms, and no visible fire extinguishers. As for the outside, yes there were very nice trees and his botanical garden was lovely, but he had 5 feral cats and chickens, so sometimes it smelt awful. The clincher to all this is when I stepped in cat poopI Tried to talk to host about problems DL

a comfortable beach house and place to escape and chill
REVIEW: 
It's a classic beach house - light, airy, casual & comfortable with minor imperfections that don't get in the way of having a great time. It is clearly used regularly based on the inventory of conveniences like condiments. There was a plentiful supply of wood for the fire which we enjoyed. We also enjoyed the Jacuzzi on cool mornings and evenings. We cooked a 6-course BD dinner for 8 in a well-equipped kitchen. Given that the enclave is locked, we felt safe and secure. The beach is close enough for a short sunrise viewing, short dog walks and longer stays for beachcombing. The one surprise we need to mention is that a dog can escape the property from the back yard though not from the front yard. He only escaped once and all was well. We had a great time!

very disappointing
REVIEW: 
Property did not deliver, especially at this price point. I will list only the most alarming shortcomings. Black mold in the showers, filthy and stained outdoor patio cushions and pillows, pool was only heated sporadically, hazardous toilet seats, which I note were initially reported in another review back in 2017, and dangerous conditions such as an uncovered exhaust fan above the cooktop and enough lint in the dryer lint filter to be a fire hazard.

The owner, Ashley, is a nice guy, but he, the property manager, and the cleaning crew have been neglecting this property for a long time.

REVIEW: 
Lovely main bedroom, although you do hear a lot of freeway noise. The grass was long and needed a mow and the pool had leaves in it. The fire pit was fantastic but the timber provided shouldn’t of been treated pine. 
The BBQ was dirty, but the deck was really lovely to sit out on. The kitchen was very clean an big but watch out for the dishwasher it tips over, when packing. If you’re tall watch your head while getting into the shower. Have fun looking for the pin pon balls we were lucky to find one near the pool area. Some instructions on how to work the tv remotes would of been handy, but comfortable lounge. I would of like to seen the local news but I could not access it. The fire alarm went off at 3:00 am for some strange reason and we don’t smoke. The blind fell on my sons head and scratched his hand as he tried to catch it in the bedroom. Overall the property was good just a couple of things needs to be looked out.

We loved our stay here and the entire family enjoyed the entire area. It was a little bit too difficult to navigate as it got darker earlier in the day and it was pitch black when we arrived. One of the rooms kept beeping throughout the day every half hour which we're assuming was a fire alarm needing new batteries.

However it was still a great trip and we loved the labeled kitchen as we were able to cook through out the day without having to spend time searching for utensils. 
We definitely plan on returning in the future.

REVIEW: 
First, this property is NOT a resort as listed. It is a nice gated community that is pretty quiet (we had one problem neighbor who wanted to stand outside and talk loud under the master bedroom window until about midnight) with a great resort-style pool. The condo itself was clean, but tired. It really needs much TLC. The sofa was hard to sit on, the cushions just sink into the frame as it is a pull out. Also, the owner was very nice and responsive, but cannot say the same for her property management company. We had a problem with a smoke alarm going off randomly and she had to resort to calling the HOA President, Andy, who came over on a Friday night to change the batteries in all the alarms. Evergreen, the Property Mgmt Co was supposed to have come over the day before, but didn't return phone calls on Friday when the problem persisted. Again, you get what you pay for so this isn't a complaint, just so anyone in the future will know before you go!

REVIEW: 
Property is well located in Greenway Plaza area on Richmond. But it is a large apartment bldg. So there are many access points. It’s cumbersome to use the app while trying to bring items in and figuring out which entrance to use. A detailed map with preferred parking area would be useful. Entrance D on 3rd floor looked to be most manageable with available spots. 

The unit itself was ok but in need of maintenance. The smoke detector was chirping when we arrived but was tended to before nightfall. But primary bath was not very clean. Hair and dirty cotton balls were on the floor. Caulking around tub was gross. Secondary bathtub was peeling and did not drain properly. Kitchen needed additional trash bags. Linens for beds and towels were all thin and not high quality. Could be a really great rental with some TLC.

TITLE: 
not what was expected ,
REVIEW: 
Upon arrival for our honeymoon , we got to the property around 10pm after a long day of travel, to a house that was cold and which had a musty smell. Contacted management they provided us with a space heater in upstairs closet , enough to heat one room only. We were instructed to use the wood stove, which was not included in information on Vrbo. We had no issue lighting the fire, the wood was there and they provided fire starter with matches. However, upon lighting fire we found the seal around the glass on the door was letting smoke in house with door shut. We proceeded to put the fire out and used the space heater and wall unit in bedroom. The wall unit makes the bedroom feel like a sauna but does not heat the rest of the house at all. We contacted host, and left the very next morning (we would have left that night, however, it was too late and no transportation was available) , the musty (potentially mouldy) smell was awful and made it difficult to breath through the night. I have asthma and I had to use my puffer in order to stay one night. The views were absolutely stunning , the pool looked amazing (we didn’t use it, as it was a short stay and it was cold. The pool is not heated, no big deal). Following these incidents we contacted the host, who required that we pay for the first night stay and a cleaning fee, however, they refunded the rest of the nights that we had already paid for. We were also left on the hook for 200 euro in cab rides to and from the accommodation . Management dealt with the issue the way they should have but the house definitely needs attention .

There is one entrance/exit; a fire hazard. The sliding door at the back is propped up with 2x4s and a sign on the door says ""this door works better."" A 3/4 inch piece of plywood was put under the couch cushions to provide stability. The couches look like something from a thrift store with unmatched cushions. Only 2 towels were provided and the kitchen was not adequate. Mismatched dishes. Furnished on the cheap. 
 Contacted the rental company, and they said ""we will bring what you need."" They never did. Washing machine sounds like a train running through the apartment. Not worth the rental price of $6K.

-chairs falling apart at dining table
-plaster all over wall where projector goes, difficult to watch movies

My friends and I rent houses every year and I guess have been lucky with good experiences. This was a very disappointing experience however there was nothing that could be done in the moment so we did not bring these matters up with the host at the time. Again, the house has so much potential with a more work and thought put into it.

Make sure you chat on VRBO app to be your proof if this happened to you and let VRBO know. This house has the potential to be a great house if it gives what it advertise. I gave it 4 star because of that or else its a 5 star.

So on arrival we noticed things weren’t as clean as they should be, parking barely fits one car. You can see right through the entire home due to only having indoor/ out door blinds.. the hot tub was completely disgusting and green. Smelled like mildew and wasn’t even plugged in. Communication with staff trying to get someone out was ridiculous and took 18 hrs for someone to show up un announced . I drained and cleaned the hot tub myself. But it never even heated up fast enough for us to use. Neighbors window stay open and have zero privacy including that owner has a ring camera on the back door looking right at the hot tub. Wouldn’t book this house ever again. Absolute Waste of money.

REVIEW: 
We had a party of 10 the fact that it had 5 bedrooms and all bedrooms had there own bath was awesome. 
The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people.

Irina the host is great, easy to communicate with, very helpful. But the disappointment was the place. The building is very old. Looks dirty. There was rat poison pieces all over the building main floor. (We had to beware with our kids) The pool was dirty, my kids didn’t even want to go in. (5-7y) We took that condo to have the pool has an option. The condo in on the Main floor, we did not expect that. The balcony is in the yard with high concrete walls with spikes at top and a lot of garbage of construction laying around everywhere. So we did not use the balcony. The bathroom needs a facelift , the bath looked dirty and lots of rust on the poles. (The sea salt would be doing that ) But the rest of the apartment was clean. The location is the highlight of this stay, right across the street, the beach is there , with the popular tiki bikini hut right there. We were able to walk everywhere with our kids. The center is a few minutes away and the fish fry we went many times , 10 min walk. Bahamian people are really nice. Nassau is a great place, we loved it !

REVIEW: 
This was a super lovely house to stay in, we had a great time, and even though you could have pets there, there was no residue of anyones pets. The aircon is only in the living space and small upstairs tv room, so even though there were fans in bedrooms it was a bit hot and sticky, and if you aren't a big fan of sharing your space with nature you'll want to keep all the beautiful shutter glass windows closed, there are no fly screens on the main living area windows. But apart from those two technicalities we had a great time. When we arrived the pool was pretty dirty but it was because the vac had stopped working, and when i called they sent someone straight over and it was sorted super quick. They could do with a new manual pool cleaner, it had big holes in it so was a bit tricky cleaning stuff off the surface out. overall all, wonderful stay.

REVIEW: 
This property is so far off the main road you can’t get a taxi or Uber so you must rent an suv. An SUV is a must since the roads are all dirt and have horrible dips. They only had a little car and we got 2 flat tires from the roads. We had no running water for 16 hours during the week. Then we had no power or water the last day we were trying to pack up to leave. The sofa was pretty dirty and you didn’t want to use. The shower head has such lower water pressure it’s hard to get all the shampoo and conditioner out so, I looked like a grease head the whole time. The pool was dirty when we arrived and after 8 days it was still never cleaned. There is a canopy over the pool which has large carabiners connection which was fine until the wind blows in the night and they are banging on the the roof all night long. There was weeks worth of bird poop on the deck in which we scrubbed for a while trying to clean because you couldn’t access the door way without stepping in it.

My daughter and I didn’t even make it twenty four hours before finding another place to stay in Fort Lauderdale. When we arrived the other guest apparently decided it was only their property and proceeded to have the tv on for the next eight hours at a level that can only make one assume they were born deaf and couldn’t afford hearing aides. They also had a dog that barked at 3:30am. Being up until 5 am with them was not my plan. The pool was kind of dirty also. And when we arrived there was a truck blocking the driveway also. And the air for the unit was controlled by the other guests. Which made it a stifling box of hot air with no air movement whatsoever. I emailed the property and asked for a refund as we weren’t returning and never got one.

REVIEW: 
Easy check in.
Pool was super dirty. None of the outside stuff worked-patio fridge/ice maker. The umbrella shown in the photos wasn’t there because of previous renters, that wasn’t communicated so after we asked they dropped off one from Walmart. Patio furniture beat up, cushions for patio furniture was all ripped, stuff hanging out and needs to be replaced. No cleaning products or laundry soap on site as the listing reads. No S&P or seasonings, no garbage bags, no full size dinner plates. No mixing/salad bowls. No hot water in the main shower with the tub. No filter in fridge water. All the cheap kitchen pans, burn your food and leave a bad taste on them. The gas stove oven, doesn’t work properly (over an hr for a cheap 20 min pizza to cook and still wasn’t done) along with a terrible gas smell. We had to buy a broom just to clean a little. The kitchen sink leaks. No pool lights as shown. The beds weren’t great. The towels weren’t plush-they’re cheap. Bathrooms were dirty, no conditioner-and it does state shampoo and soap, but that’s it. Closet doors missing in rooms. I could go on and on. I’m not a rich, bougie person. I camp and don’t mind working with very little, but this place isn’t what is sold to you. It’s very cheaply put together with bare minimum, mismatched thrown together stuff, sold as something far different… I’ve stayed in a lot of places, I wouldn’t stay here again, especially for the money. Very disappointed we flew in from across the country for that. Sucks to work hard for a family vacation, have your hopes up and be so swiftly let down. 
Now, I will say, after we contacted them, they did have them come out right away and clean the pool some, and as I stated, they dropped off a Walmart umbrella. So that was nice. But there just isn’t any effort or extras and it definitely shows. They’re making bank and not putting in anything to make the stay nice for guests from out of state.

This place takes 640 dollars as a cleaning fee. To clean BEFORE you check in and after. You'd expect the property to BE CLEAN, but no. 
Crumbs left on the couch
Hand prints all over the windows
Oil deposit on the stove top
Finger prints on the chairs. 
The blinds wete broken, so you are left without a view. 
The pool was disgusting. Excessive leaf deposits, bandaids, tissues in the water. Water level of the pool was very low.

Wasted a whole days worth not being able to access the pool, to a point where we tried to clean it ourselves. 
Contacted property managers only to get a response the NEXT DAY. 
Unacceptable, we wasted a days fee to clean when we should have been able to enjoy as soon as we checked in.
Do not stay here unless you want to waste money

And pest control didn't come until a few days into our stay. Even after they came, we still had the pest issue. The overall cleanliness of this house was poor. The hot tub was dirty and drained and therfore not in working condition. This was misleading as it was shown in working condition in the photos. Also the second day we had no hot water.

REVIEW: 
The Hotel is quite dated, old and in need of some TLC. The room was adequate, but the bed was absolutely awful, with a very worn out mattress, zero support. The lounge area was as hard as rock and not very comfortable either. The dispensers in the bathroom were almost empty, and needed refilling. The fridge was leaking of water inside. The next morning before 8 am someone tried to enter the room (i assume to clean) why I do not know, as it is a 10am checkout so not very impressed at all. The Restaurant food was also very average. The food was overcooked especially the pasta. The 'fresh' cooked vegies were a pulpy mess , a small serve and served on a dinner plate!! The pool had algae growing in it and again is very old and not very clean. Apart from a cheery receptionist, no, we will not recommend this Hotel nor will we revisit.

Multiple/Various pieces of furniture are damaged and unsightly. 
We were extremely disappointed to find that the one request I had written in the special request was not even taken into consideration. Our special request being the hot tub be clean and ready to use for my birthday. Again it was cold and the bottom was filled with scum. I have a picture. 
The dish ware was damaged and we had to cook with Teflon that was severely chipping.
Otherwise we made the best of what we had.

Electrical was suspect with melted electrical outlets. Furniture dirty and from the 1980’s. Landscaping was let go with overgrown weeds and rusty pool screening and green pool to look at every day. Dock is dilapidated. Kayaks were both broken down with broken seats and in poor condition. SUP was not provided. Upper deck seemed unsafe with ancient furniture. Really low class. Do not plan on cooking just not feasible in the kitchenette. Also the owners are right there every day, they never go anywhere, so there is no privacy at all. The owners are all nice enough (4 adults). They just seem unable to do any kind of work or maintenance on the property. I just want future renters to know what to expect if they choose to rent.

REVIEW: 
The house is in a great, quiet location. The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat. The property manager and owner said to leave the bedroom doors open and there are also 2 space heaters to heat the main areas. The space heaters were way to small to make a difference and the main areas were quite cold. None of the living room lights worked nor the living room fan, the pool was filthy, master bedroom faucet was loose, no cable, so no live TV, no garage door transmitters and the shower water pressure was not good. Due to having no heat in the main areas, we would not stay there again. We could look past all of the other issues, but with the main areas too cold to be in, we will look at other properties for our next visit.

I usually do not leave reviews unless it is exceptional or horrible. This place was horrible. The pool was dirty with scum. I complained to the owner and he said the “manager” would clean it. Never was cleaned. My teenage boys would not even swim in the pool. No lights in the back yard so you could not enjoy the cool evenings. No lights in the back-yard patio. I advised the manager, he said “oh sorry”… but yet the lights were not replaced. Windows were filthy. The ad says totally renovated. No. Maybe the entrance and the kitchen. Holes in the walls, dirty walls, filthy windows. The tracks in the master bedroom was so full of dirt - disgusting. The dishes were dirty had to clean them before we used them. Could not find a sharp knife anywhere. We rented for 7 days, not enough garbage bags, not enough dish washer soap. I have many pictures that I wish I could post so that you could see for yourself. Would not book in the future.

property not maintained
REVIEW: 
Rented a house to stay during the holidays to visit with family and friends who lived in Florida. Enjoyed that part of my stay. 
The best thing about the house was the tiki hut although the covers on the lounge chair were dry rotted and need to be replaced. One of the first things that happened was that my dog got out of the back yard because the latch on the gate was broken. Then the coffee maker didn’t work because it needed to be descaled. Three weeks in the pool turned green because it hadn’t been serviced and we couldn’t use it for a week while it cleared out. Although the house is in one level the floor isn’t level, not good for anyone with mobility issues. Then there is the pool table that takes up a third of the living space with a broken pool que.
The furniture is uncomfortable and sparse, no tables where you need them for for putting down a drink or book.
When the drainage pipe for the sinks and bathrooms backed up that was disgusting.
When the air conditioning stopped working on New Years Eve and it took 6 days for it ti be repaired in eighty degree weather it was anything but comfortable.
After a while I felt like I was there as a test Tennant to see what needed to be done to fix the home’s problems. Oh I forgot the the vent filters under the microwave look like they have never been cleaned, something is hanging down from them.
As my son told me it would be better to stay in a hotel. It would be cheaper an you have maid service and the amenities are maintained.

If you like ski in/out lodging, this place is absolutely perfect. However, be aware that the unit is well worn and in need of lots of TLC and updating in general. Kitchen has no exhaust fan as the Microwave over the stove does not work and instead of replacing it, a cheap freestanding microwave has been installed. Water pressure is not great and the water heater capacity is marginal at best. Mattresses in the non master bedrooms could do with replacements.

The home was a perfect size for our family weekend away. There were 11 of us and there was plenty of room at the large kitchen table for us to eat together and plenty of seating in the living room. You cannot beat the view out to the ocean and down to Dillon Beach. 
The owner was super responsive when I called her on Friday night with a question. The two downsides to the house were that the hot tub was not clean and therefore not usable. I did not alert the owner to this while we were there, so I essentially gave her no way to right this. The other item was that while the house was clean, the kitchen dishes/prep bowls/pans were dirty. We had to wash most everything before use.

TITLE: 
vacation ruined
REVIEW: 
Let me preference this by saying that I only take a vacation about every 5 years and really needed this one. Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

All-in-all it was a disappointing stay.

REVIEW: 
I expected a condo or a townhome, not a room in a hotel. The hotel lobby and surrounding areas are pretty dated and don’t smell pleasant. Neither does the old carpet in the hallways of the entire hotel. Check in process was weird going to a lockbox in a stairwell and told not to go to front desk. Hotel room was decent although not exceptionally clean. The pull out couch is not a sleeper sofa it’s more a futon style that reclines but doesn’t sleep 2 hardly at all. My 2 boys who are 12 and 13 couldn’t get comfortable and have room. Not sure I’d advertise this a bed. The pool wasn’t clean and had black stuff floating in it all 3 days we saw it. I felt the ad was misleading making it sound like a condo or townhome when really it’s a room in a dated smelly hotel. Communication is great with the host but I was not impressed with the room.

REVIEW: 
My friends and I were sorely disappointed and couldn't wait to leave! 

The house was extremely dirty with months of accumulation of dust and dirt behind doors and in corners. Dishes had to be washed before use as they had food and lipstick/Chapstick stains on them. 

The hot tub water was murky and filled with dirt due to broken clasps on the covering and it being blown open by the wind. Completely unusable. 

The bedding and bathroom floor was covered in human hair. However, the last straw was the pine beetle bugs. Hundreds of them! We were forced to sit in the dark to avoid them falling on us and in our drinks/food from the ceilings. Even that didn't help much.

I contacted the property management before our departure and still have not received a response. The smelly water is the least of your worries. 

It's really too bad as the home is cute, in a great area, and near to recreation. Better luck elsewhere.

REVIEW: 
So overall the cabin was beautiful. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday weekend. We checked out the cabin to see the rooms and the bedroom was filthy and the sheets looked like someone had just jumped out of bed and in the downstairs bathroom dirty towels were everywhere. It was clear it was never cleaned. The hot tub was also filthy and the manager said they won’t clean it because on weekends they have some weird water policy that it can’t be filled. Had I known that I would’ve booked a cabin where I could’ve used the hot tub! Upstairs, the trash was never taken out and in the upstairs bathroom, there was a small trashbag with used tampons in it! Yuck! We had to sleep on the pull out sofa upstairs until they came to clean it the next day. Kim the manager did refund my cleaning fee and my hot tub fee and she handled the situation very professionally. The view was amazing though and had it not been that the place was so dirty, I’d book again! The drive up was a little steep but obviously worth it for the Mountain View!

Box fan in the unit was broken and comforter had large unidentified stains as well on couch in main living area. Bed frame in master BR had sharp wood edges sticking out, which we hit our shins on regularly. Access to the town shuttle was convenient and we could walk to some locations. I expected nicer accommodations for what we paid per night. I will stay at one of the higher end hotels in town next time close to the Gondola.

Electrical was suspect with melted electrical outlets. Furniture dirty and from the 1980’s. Landscaping was let go with overgrown weeds and rusty pool screening and green pool to look at every day. Dock is dilapidated. Kayaks were both broken down with broken seats and in poor condition. SUP was not provided. Upper deck seemed unsafe with ancient furniture. Really low class. Do not plan on cooking just not feasible in the kitchenette. This is a 120.00 a night VRBO not 220 that we paid. Also the owners are right there every day, they never go anywhere, so there is no privacy at all. The owners are all nice enough (4 adults). They just seem unable to do any kind of work or maintenance on the property. I just want future renters to know what to expect if they choose to rent.

Location: Great location in Seminyak close to restaurants and shops. Can’t use a large vehicle for a big group due to the narrow alleyways.
Facility: The photos on the website hugely oversold the property. When we arrived swimming pool was dirty and full of debris, dining area was full of cigarette butts, sliding door to MBR was not working, shower heads in many rooms were clogged, furniture in living room outdated and need replacing, very poor amenities in bedrooms and bathrooms. The list goes on. Bottom line this property needs renovation and maintenance.
Staff: the people made our stay very enjoyable ! They are friendly, attentive and responsive. The chef Mr. Gusti can prepare excellent meals (Asian or western foods) for a large group. The driver Mr Hendrik is very knowledgeable about Bali and area restaurants and places to go.
I give the staff 10 out of 10 rating.

-mopping floors, cleaning toilets and showers, stripping beds, vacuuming, mopping to name a few was too much all the while trying to get out on time with young kids. It was hectic. 
I don’t understand a cleaning fee when we did most of the cleaning.

Oh and the house is for sale so we got to experience local real estate agents driving/stopping by, so we got to worry about strangers accessing our rental property while we were out.

To top this off, Evolve the property management company has double billed my credit card, so now I get to fight with them and my bank to get charges all sorted out.

The trash was still piled up from the previous users outside. There was only 6 towels for 8 people. No towels for the spa, the bath jets were not clean, lack of laundry supplies and dish washing supplies. We had to go to target to get cheap towels! The pots and pans can use updating.

Overall, its a great space for 2 families with preteens.

REVIEW: 
House is nice and spacious but the care it receives from whoever is in charge of maintaining the property is not doing a good job. The floors in the kitchen were sticky and dirty. There was garbage under the sofas and the beds, the overall furniture in the whole house looks and feels dirty and very old. The outdoor furniture doesn't have covers, could not use it. The pool was dirty and I paid for it to be warm but it never happened. I think the AC is broken and has been for a while. I will never rent a property showing Orlando Short Term as the host.

great spot, but bring a few extra things
REVIEW: 
I’ve been going to Panguitch Lake for over a decade. 
House was very nice house. Could have comfortably fit a lot more people. Nice and private up on a mountain. Super close to the lake. Great views. 

Due to the weather, we came in early and to the owners credit, was cool with it. We were arriving after a very messy previous guest, which shocked me because we always leave a place cleaner than we found it. Cleaning lady had only just gotten there. We dropped our gear, changed and left but she may have felt rushed and didn’t clean master spa and shower. Found a bunch of hair and ring around the tub. We cleaned it and give her a pass as we invaded her cleaning time.

There are really only a few suggesting I would make, but important ones. I usually share these directly with the owner and leave it off the reviews but I received no response to my feedback, so rather than risk the next person having problems, I’ll list on here.

1. No snow shovels. It snowed 3-4 feet during out stay and although there was a plow, it doesn’t get up to the vehicle. Bring one if you have one.
2. Fancy espresso machine and a keurig, but no standard coffee pot. Also, no keurig inserts. I brought grinds but ended up drinking cappuccinos the entire time when I just wanted to have my normal cup of coffee.
3. Fire place is cool but wood was not dried out and no tinder. I have been making fires for years and nothing helped. 
4 Last but not least, house is very hard to find. Not marked well.

My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Likewise the hot tub wasn't clean and some of the jets didn't work. Beyond these issues, the place was great!

I don't even know where to start. I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

This was my second time renting this property because the first time it was so great. The house itself is nice, spacious, has a fenced yard, and good location. 
However, this time the hot tub was VERY dirty and there were beer cans around the yard when we arrived. 
We are not people to usually leave a review so we contacted the owner to let them know directly(with photos) and they never got back to us.

REVIEW: 
The kitchen was really well stocked with appliances, dishes, bowls, etc and the best of any place we’ve stayed. 

The place was nice but the hot tub was filled with algae when we arrived and wasn’t treated for two of the four nights we were there. The management company was super responsive to my emails but correcting the issue was not as responsive. When the shower knob fell out, maintenance was out within several hours which was appreciated. 

Loved the standing desk and monitor in the master so nice of you do have to work a little while on vacation. 

Like some other vacation rentals in the area, you have to LOVE stairs as there are a LOT of them. The builder who thought a metal spiral staircase to the hot tub was clearly imbibing or enjoying from the green medical signs! No doubt they were trying to take advantage of space, but it’s a weird setup. 

I would suggest the owners put in a larger tv in the main floor as watching a football playoff game on a tiny tv was a little bit of a bummer. There is a larger one on the lower floor but not much seating. 

Minus the stairs, I think I would love this place a lot more outside of the winter skiing season. The driveway was tight with the snow but we loved seeing the bikes that could be used in non-snowing seasons.

TITLE: 
absolutely horrible experience!!!!
REVIEW: 
I would never give a 1 star review but unfortunately I'm forced to do so because of the terrible customer service we received from Meredith Logging.
We picked up the cabin's key around 3:55 in the office and were told that the cabin was ready by the time we arrived. We arrived at the cabin around 4 and the person who was cleaning asked for 20 more minutes.
He did not let us unload and it was super cold so we headed to the starbucks. We came back around 4:40 and the cabin was not ready yet. 
Finally he left the cabin around 5 pm and let us in after 4 hours of driving & waiting. 
After turning on the heater we felt an unpleasant smell in one of the bedrooms on the third floor.
We opened the window, closed the door, contacted the office (5:50pm). They promised to send someone to fix it, but after exchanging messages they said they cannot send anyone till the day after. 
We rented this property just because of the number of bedrooms it has so we can have our privacy. But due to this issue two of us ended up sleeping on the sofa in the living room.
Beside this issue the hot tub was super dirty. We have also found most of the sheets with stains and many pillows without covers. I wore my jacket and preferred not to use the dirty blankets and sheets. It was very disappointing.
The day after around noon we stopped by at the office to follow up (since they send no one). The person who did not let us in on check-in day was there and he acted like all the sheets were clean and he was not aware of the hot tub issue until we showed him the photo. Then he acted like he was taking notes and he would send someone to fix the problems.
Finally around 5 pm on Saturday a maintenance team member showed up and he said he cannot fix the bad odor and hot tub shortly and promised to document the issues.
During the checkout, we mentioned again about our terrible experience and they said that someone from their refund team will contact us which they never did. So we followed up a couple times and they kept saying that someone will be in contact soon. Couple days passed and no one contacted us. We finally were able to get a hold of someone and they simply refunded us $30 for the hot tub only. We spent over 2k for this property and we just got $30 back despite the fact that we couldn't use one of the rooms at all plus dirty hot tub and sheets; very disappointing. 
I would definitely not recommend this property and any other properties Managed by Meredith Logging.

REVIEW: 
I rented this beautiful property for a late Christmas celebration with my two daughters and their families. The living room was perfect for a wonderful afternoon of presents. The kids were very excited to swim outdoors in January and the adults were excited to hang out in the hot tub. Unfortunately, the hot tub was not working, (and had not worked in a while) and the pool was a little green. The doors, vents and corners were not clean and the overhead rain showerhead in the master bath did not have hot water. Otherwise, the rest of the property was accommodating.

The property was beautiful, pool, outdoor area to seat with a fire place. Rooms were roomy and spacious for everyone. 

Some issues were AC battery out on thermostat owner took a while to answer back and pool was dirty due to a storm on prior fay but someone was there but not in a sufficient time for us to be able to enjoy the pool. My other issue is that they need to disclose that you have to buy your own propane gas as none was available and we had to buy our own, than the grill needs to be updated as it was all rotted out so we couldn’t grill outdoor. 

The guest bathroom shower had hair on the wall and the stove burners some didn’t work, assure to inspect property to assure all is available and clean mainly the bathrooms.

Overall it was beautiful!

TITLE: 
vacation ruined
REVIEW: 
Let me preference this by saying that I only take a vacation about every 5 years and really needed this one. Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

I have never rented with Vrbo before. I have always used AirBNB. However, I don’t think this was Vrbo’s fault. I will simply always rent with an individual owner, not with a vacation rental management company like Vacasa.

REVIEW: 
We stayed over the long xmas weekend 2022. The picture and description should include the statement, not for bad knee or anyone old or young that is unstable. No mention of the steep driveway (which was not cleared) Thank God for 4 wheel drive. OR steep outside steps to front door and decks with thick ice and crusty hard snow. The Septic tank needs to be emptied, as the whole house smells when you do dishes, take a shower or run the washer. 
No way this was going to be fixed over the holiday weekend so we were stuck in a smelly house for 4+ days. 
If your a cook bring your tools and supplies - basic items provided. 
Hot tub had 3 working jets and was murky. 
The carpets were stained and needed cleaning asap.
The sound of guns being fired started at 7am and went all day, which was unsettling the dogs, as well as us. Loud bags and rapid fire,. They must have gotten guns for xmas? 
We made the best of it and reported to Mt. Properties management, who offered us a 5 percent discount on our next visit.

I called manager to clear the ice dam that was blocking front door, which they refused to do even after I calling to tell them I fell and broke my ankle. 
My husband ended up shoveling the walkway, three times. There is a terrible neighbor who yelled at us in the parking lot two days in a row. On our last day, he threatened to hit my husband with a ski pole. 
On top of the ice damn and no snow removal, the front deck was covered in dog poop. I asked the manager if they could clean it up, which they refused to do. We paid more than $10k for the time we rented this property, so hopefully you can understand our frustration. We will definitely NOT be back.

REVIEW: 
Overall our stay was fine. There were some things that need improvement. The location in proximity to stores and disney world parks is perfect. It is a little farther from the pool area than we usually prefer. This is a very large complex.
They did provide a pack n play and kids dishes which was great. However there is not 1 single pan to be used in the oven. This house has 5 bedrooms with atleast 1 themed for children, children who typically love fries and chicken nuggets, we need a baking pan.
Also, the kitchen table and coffee table are not kid friendly. They are glass with pointy corners.
The kitchen table has a sharp metal piece on the under side that I cut my leg on twice, we then put a bandaid over the metal.
There are lots of dirt and markings over the walls, not a game changer but aesthically displeasing.
There are a few light bulbs that need to be changed. The lights would turn on and then flicker off after 20 minutes. 
The pool table sticks had broken tips.
The most annoying thing about staying here is that there is terrible cell service so wifi is a necessity. Well the wifi did not work for the first 3 days. I was able to contact someone when we left the house but then did not receive the response until the next day due to no service. When the company came to fix it they told us it's known that cell service here is terrible. 
Since we stayed here for our disney vacation I had to get up early to go to Starbucks down the rode 3 mornings in a row to book genie +, this was highly frustrating.
Overall, the house for the price was a bit disappointing but once the wifi was fixed it served its purpose for sleeping there while enjoying the parks. There are a lot of little things that need to taken care of.

wonderful stay
REVIEW: 
The location of the property was perfect for us as we were 5 mins away from where we need to be during the week. 

Our host from the onset was very communicative and quick to respond. The apartment had been cleaned early and she reached out to let us know we could check in early even though we didn't ask for it so that was a nice touch, pity we weren't in town yet. 

The apartment was accurate according to the listing and nothing was not a surprise to us which is always nice.

I would say that if you are a tall person (6' 3""), like myself, I would just be a little wary as the ceilings are lower than usual apartments. The issue really wasn't the ceiling in my case, it was the door frames. I banged my head a couple of times not thinking but it was not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The bathroom was clean and had plenty of body wash, shampoo and conditioner which was nice to have. 

I would recommend the host to add aluminum foil in the apartment because one day we made frozen pizzas in the oven and as the tray provided had gaps in it we had a little bit of a crumb cleanup because it was impossible to prevent crumbs falling through. 

Parking at the property was very convenient with a caveat. Parking is in the alley way where it's super tight. With a passenger van it's a tight squeeze and you have to be super careful not to not anything. 

Overall, it was a great stay hence the 5 star rating. Thank you for a lovely stay. Would certainly recommend to anyone.

This was a perfect getaway! The cabin was clean and comfortable, they allowed our dogs! The only concern I have is the stairs outside, they were very slippery and I took a fall from the top all the way down. I would recommend to put some gripping tape on them. Other than that it was perfect!

nice house but safety / construction issues
REVIEW: 
Moose tracks is a really nice rental, with newer finishes, ample room, and beautiful amenities. It’s well maintained and clean. 

However, since it looks like it’s a new construction, we had a couple of issues. One is that on the stairs going down to the basement, there were exposed staples which cut my friends foot as she was doing down. I sent pictures to the Vacasa host but no real response and it wasn’t taken care of. This is a safety hazard. The second, and less important, issue was that the hot tub wasn’t properly working. We were able to
Resolve this with help from the Vacasa team but took a long time and we couldn’t use the tub.

Overall, nice house but with some issues.

REVIEW: 
Overall - we enjoyed our stay at the Villa. It's a beautiful property. We also hired chefs through Sandra's kitchen which made for a comfortable eating experience. Most of the bedrooms had a mildew smell, which I suppose is understandable in a tropical environment. Unfortunately, one of the lasting memories of our stay were two of my family members injuring themselves on a missing step on the path into the water. One family member bloodied up his lower leg badly and another family member ended up falling and hitting her head and chest. It has been two weeks since our stay and unfortunately her chest pains are still there. I've notified the property manager of the issue so I hope it won't affect future guests.

gorgeous house but cleanliness and amenities of property were lacking
REVIEW: 
Mattresses were all hard as a rock. My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

last week of january stay
REVIEW: 
The weather was horrible. There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps.

REVIEW: 
The property was of a great location and simple walk to lake and town, however there are a few items we feel need addressing for future guests:
The pedestal basin in the ensuite is very loose and the first night my wife leaned down on it when it moved she fell over. Having no silicon seal is also a little unhygienic.
The tap in kitchen sink is very loose and you had to hold at the base when using it, again silicon seal not effective allowing water to splash under.
We only used the BBQ once as the tray in bottom with absorbent caught fire, i had gone into the kitchen and luckily my daughter saw the flames and i managed to extinguish. Definitely needs changing out.

All these are minor issues that could be easily fixed. Thanks for the use.

He was extremely helpful. When I fell and broke my wrist he took me to the clinic, stayed to do the translation for us and only left after we were seen to. After we got home, he came over and drove us to a mall so that I could get the brace that I need for my wrist. Then he drove us around the area by the house and pointed out the shops, stores etc. He was always available to answer any question we had, When we had a small problem with the hot water, he came over right away to see what was needed, it turned out to be that we needed gas.
The house was as advertised, very nice and clean with lots of the things, dishes, utensils etc. we needed. He had even put a lovely chocolate cake in the fridge for our arrival. I highly recommend this house to anyone interested. It is in an ideal location and close to a lot of stores. When I return to Merida I'll certainly rent this property again..

2 month stay after birth of grandson
REVIEW: 
This property was clean and well-stocked. Since we were staying for two months, I assumed I would need to replenish the paper products myself. I was wrong - there was plenty of TP and paper towels for our entire stay! The kitchen was also well stocked. There were even a few of my favorite Pampered Chef tools available, much to my delight!

It was mainly my husband and I who stayed here but the other rooms were used off-and-on by our adult children and grandkids. All the beds were very comfortable, and we were happy to use the portable playpen for the new baby and the toys and books for the 3-year-old.

There was no carpet and no stairs - which worked fantastic for my blind dog and my husband, who dislocated his ankle and broke his fibula shortly after arriving in Missoula. So if you are looking for an easy-to-maneuver house, this one will work great! :-)

The only suggestions for improvement is that the couch, although a perfect fit for the living room, definitely should be updated (owner said this is planned for spring), and the neighbors, while friendly, did not shovel the driveway as planned every time it snowed. In Missoula, snow tends to melt on the driveway within a couple of days anyway, but with my husband in a boot and on a scooter, he was not able to shovel the driveway himself so sometimes it was snow-packed for a few days.

Communication with the owner was pleasant and quick. She even left Griz onesies as a present for our new grandson - very thoughtful! We will stay here again!

We arrived at the property to learn that the washing machine was broken, (it was fixed a few days later), that the house was only about 15 feet from a very busy highway with speed bumps close by resulting in screeching trucks and vehicles all day and night. The pool is described as chilly…it was freezing and mostly in the shade as was the lovely courtyard. We swam in it only twice. The open areas in the main floor bedroom bathroom and on staircase allowed animals into the main living area. The host resolved this by having the maintenance man affix a lock on the door leading to the upstairs bedrooms but nothing was done about the bathroom. Animals still got in. The host also purchased some fresh towels and coffee mugs during our stay. Kitchen is fairly well stocked but many pot lids were broken and utensils needed replacing. We felt that the house was overpriced at 4500 Canadian dollars for 3 weeks. We will not be staying here again.

REVIEW: 
I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully an honest review will help others considering this property. 

For starters, when we flipped one of the comforters around we found blood all over the backside. No one from our group had been bleeding and when we sprayed it with cleaner the blood turned orange like the comforter hadn't been washed at all. 

It doesn't seem like whoever runs this property has actually stayed here. The mattresses are all so uncomfortable my parents rented a separate place to stay in so they could get some sleep. There weren't enough towels for eight people. There wasn't enough room for our family (8 people) to sit together in the living room. Multiple outlets don't work. Neither of the coffee makers work.

My sister called the property management company and they brought more towels and a new coffee maker. However, they never responded to my message when I sent them a photo of the bloody comforter and listed other concerns. 

My family drove nine hours to stay here and we all couldn't wait to leave. Not how you want to spend a family vacation. 

To end on a positive note: The cabin had a lot of space, the location is great and the hot tub was nice. They also sent a crew to clear the deck and stairs of snow.

REVIEW: 
The property is not set up for six people. The living room has one small sofa- and the only TV in the house is in the living room. The kitchen has chairs that are way too low for the height of the bar. We had to buy coffee cups- there were only 4- There weren't enough towels for 6 people- nor enough pots/pans to cook (what's there is seen better days). The check in instructions in the VRBO sent 3 days prior were wrong. The revised one was sent while we were flying so of course we didn't see them. The condo # on our reservation (1212) was wrong. We were in 1210- All of these issues I found out by trying to enter the wrong door. The guest in 1212 was very irate and slammed the door in our faces. The floors in 1210 were a danger hazard- the transitions between the tile and the laminate were poorly installed and uneven. Between the kitchen tile and the laminate, large portions of the transitions have come unglued. One of our friends slipped and fell and hit his head. There are other areas in the upstairs and downstairs bedroom where the laminate floor is also uneven. After that incident which we contacted the owner we decided to cut our stay short and leave two days early. She acted suspicious so I sent her a photo of the area were our guest tripped. She disingenuously told us to go see a doctor and she would reimburse us, yet refused to credit us for the two days. Overall, it was the worst experience ever!

REVIEW: 
Walked in the place and was surprised that this home had only 4 bedroom, the extra bedroom was the 4th room not the 5th. The Living-room isn’t large enough for 5 people. There were broken items in the home and when I attempted to call to communicate Justin did not answers Justin only answered when I first arrived and when I left. Steps were not salted and had ice where I slipped multiple times. I fell on a broken kitchen chair and bumped my head as well as other family members. Don’t stay here as the practices are unfair.

REVIEW: 
I will start out by saying that the property was clean. I appreciate that.
The security was dismal. Our separate poolside flop house( for which we spent 1/3 of the price)did not lock and the door screen blew in the wind. If we left the glass door open to the breeze a cat came in through the screen! One panel in the outside shower ( our only shower in the cabana bedroom)was broken so you were naked to the island. We had to figure out how to make the water warm. 
There were six of us but 5 beach chairs. The snorkeling equipment was too old and not effective. No hand towels or washcloths and only one dish towel. We could not wash towels and reuse as the dryer was broken the whole time! We had to haul gallons of water because the manager told us not to drink the filtered? water. There are no deadbolts as advertised. 
The manager and his girlfriend stayed under the main house which made us worried about being noisy at all. 
The furniture in the main house was quite shabby. Uncovered metal leftovers of buttons cut into your legs when you sat on the couch. Honestly? It would have been an adventuresome fun rental if we paid half the price. We felt taken.

disappointing
REVIEW: 
I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully an honest review will help others considering this property. 

For starters, when we flipped one of the comforters around we found blood all over the backside. No one from our group had been bleeding and when we sprayed it with cleaner the blood turned orange like the comforter hadn't been washed at all. 

It doesn't seem like whoever runs this property has actually stayed here. The mattresses are all so uncomfortable my parents rented a separate place to stay in so they could get some sleep. There weren't enough towels for eight people. There wasn't enough room for our family (8 people) to sit together in the living room. Multiple outlets don't work. Neither of the coffee makers work.

My sister called the property management company and they brought more towels and a new coffee maker. However, they never responded to my message when I sent them a photo of the bloody comforter and listed other concerns. 

My family drove nine hours to stay here. It was $2k for three nights, in addition to the separate place my parents rented, and we all couldn't wait to leave. Not how you want to spend a family vacation. 

To end on a positive note: The cabin had a lot of space, the location is great and the hot tub was nice. They also sent a crew to clear the deck and stairs of snow.

This spot was perfect for our family of five. Check in was a little old school with a lock box attached to a door- but it was easy to get in. The home was well stocked with anything you could possibly need. We loved the goodies provided, especially the local soap and tea! We spent the afternoon watching the wildlife in the backyard- turkeys in the trees, and deer meandering by. The house was super comfortable, and the natural light was amazing. The toys provided kept our children more than entertained. The library of books was amazing! Our only concern is that there was no handrail on the stairs, and my husband hurt his knee because of it. The hosts sent great communication via text, but we didn’t hear back from them when we requested a late check out (which is totally fine). All in all, the Chickadee chalet was perfect for our family and we would love to stay here again.

We had the best 3 nights here with 2 surfing families. The location is epic, Graham Colyer drive has two public cut throughs which made the property super accessible to the beach and the shops on foot, skateboards or bikes. It’s far enough out of the hub that it provides a relaxed and peaceful retreat to return to after a day at the main beach. We utilised the track through Sandcastle’s Resort to access the beach for early morning surfs. The house itself has a relaxed beach vibe and quirky charm. Unfortunately linen was not supplied which was the only down side. We took two dogs and unfortunately there are gaps under the front fences and our small dog got out one morning but was returned by a friendly local. We loved the front deck and spent most of our time at the house relaxing on it. Would absolutely book this house again.

We arrived to dirty dishes in the sink, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, a sink drain full of rotten food, and the garbage disposal smelled horrible. The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!

great location but poor unit
REVIEW: 
Cannot beat the location for ski in/ski out convenience and proximity to the village. But my positive points pretty much end there. All of the furniture and appliances in the unit are the absolute cheapest you can find in their categories. Beds were hard as rocks with lumpy, uneven pillows to match. Couch was also lumpy and uncomfortable. Several of the dining room chairs were legitimately about to fall apart, wobbling, or crooked; someone is going to sit down and injure themselves on those things! The microwave makes a terrible sound that is not confidence inspiring. The heat in the unit is odd, the bedrooms got very hot at night despite leaving the heaters off 100% of the time we were there. My only guess is heat from adjacent units makes them warm and no there is real way to cool them off short of opening a window in the freezing cold winter. I could go on, but those are the highlights. In short this unit cost WAAAAY too much money for there to be any excuse for the state that it was in. I paid over $600/night (after all the fees and taxes are added in) to get terrible sleep for 4 nights.

I contacted VRBO & they couldn't reach my host, either. It was 48 hours out and I still hadn't received access instructions. At that point, I booked a hotel. At 24 hours out, still nothing from my host. I called him & phone was disconnected. On my day of arrival I got a message saying my reservation had been canceled & I had been refunded.

This cozy townhome was perfect for our weekend at Beech Mountain. It was a close (less than 5 min) drive to the mountain, easy to access, and had everything we needed to cook all of our meals. The view is absolutely incredible and it was nice to just curl up by the fireplace and take in the view. I have reduced my rating by 1 star because the interior stairs of this home are quite steep. The height of the risers were higher than your average staircase and although there is a handrail, it is also higher than normal taking more effort to reach for.

two night break
REVIEW: 
We booked a two night stay at this property at the beginning of January 2023. The house was lovely, nicely decorated, very clean and spacious. The location was great, we were practically in the grounds of the abbey and the views of Whitby were amazing. We had zero complaints about the inside of the property. 

I did have a fall on the pathway leading to the door of the property as a large stone bollard was placed across the pathway and as there was no outside lighting and the bollard was not highlighted in anyway the fell over it in the dark and suffered some nasty cuts and grazes, it was a shame is it happened within two hours of checking in so put a slight dampener on the break! So just be careful of that bollard if you stay. 

We were really keen to re-book this place and we even had a few friends that were interested after we showed them the pictures however we won’t book this place again due to the after contact with Home Stay who are the company that look after the property. 

I left a couple of things behind at the house and it took 4 emails and 2 phone calls over a period of two weeks to finally be told they didn’t have my items. Two items were left in the washing machine by mistake and they have claimed that nothing was handed in. I know full well that they were left so to tell me that house-keeping didn’t find anything was a blatant lie as well as being fobbed off for two weeks. The items weren’t super expensive but did cost me £50.00 to replace, as one item was a equa-fleece dog all in one suit and a pair of bamboo socks. It was just so disappointing that they clearly have some very dishonest staff who would happily help themselves to guests property, whether that was keeping it themselves or disposing of it because they couldn’t be bothered to save it for me. 

I also sent through the pictures of my injuries after the fall and I just received a ‘sorry about that and the ‘bollard was put there by the neighbour so not really our problem’ type of response - despite the bollard being on the pathway leading to the door of the property. 

Anyway, all I would say is, the house is lovely you will not be disappointed but just be very aware of the stone bollard and do not accidentally leave any items behind as you will not see them again.

The condo was great, very clean and well stocked, The location is amazing. Just a little ways down from the Soaring Eagle lift. The condo has an awesome ski room where all equipment can be stored and easily put on and taken off. Walk out the back door and you are on Upper Flume, a green run. You can either make your way down the bank or walk ~ 10 feet over to a staircase that is pretty easy to navigate. Head out on your skis and either continue on the green, stop for a drink at the Flume Shack or cut right and go down J Hook (our favorite blue). After skiing, it’s easy to ski right to the unit and get in the back door. At night, catch the bus right out the front door to Appalachia Kitchen (amazing food), Tuque’s (pizza!) or go a little further to the Village for mexican at Sunset Cantina (ask for Cassie!). Then come back and play your favorite game on the large and beautiful dining room table or jump in the hot tub (comfortable for 4 adults).

The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

REVIEW: 
This is a large home that accommodated my family of eight plus 4 dogs. We all slept well and were comfortable. I expected a lot more for the money we spent though. Bathrooms and kitchen were clean but other areas needed more attention (hair and debris on the night tables etc). There is a large broken armchair that resides in the living room for some reason that is a hazard. Lots of broken blinds. Back door to apartment unit would not open. Hot tub barely accessible (i had to call company to send someone to try and sculpt out a safer access after 3 of us had slipped and fallen). I had to clean up after previous renters dog. Etc... no pride of ownership with this property. Run by a company. Reached out a few days before check in to see if they had a pack and play and high chair, but didnt hear back until day after check in. Was advised that this property did not have those items but in actual fact they do! They were in the large closet located off the living room. This all being said, we enjoyed the area and being able to be all together.

Let me start with the communication with the property manger was awesome! He responded to all calls and emails. I am a travel agent and was disappointed with the property. The house is very spacious and could accommodate all ages. However I took pictures of the areas that were not appealing. The walls had stains on them throughout. There was a smell throughout the house that I had to go and purchase febreeze to try and remove. The sofas downstairs had several stains the arm rest on the sofa was broken and the smell on the sofas upstairs and downstairs was horrible. We went to the store and purchased bed sheets to lay on the sofas so that we could sit on them. The home needs new furniture, febreezed and walls repainted upstairs and downstairs.

REVIEW: 
All in all, this rental felt like someone hastily slapped together a cheap hotel room without actually testing anything out to make sure it was actually comfortable. If you're looking to rent somewhere that is comfortable enough to feel like someone’s vacation home, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.

The location of this rental was decent; it was very close to the Disney parks, Walmart, and within walking distance to the pool in the complex. The rental was also very clean, and reasonably accurate to the pictures in the listing. That being said, the rental itself needs some major TLC. The floors and showers squeak loudly, and the tiles outside of the children's room upstairs are cracked and broken. The springs in the large couch were broken/missing, so when you sat on it the frame of the couch dug into your legs. The beds are all extremely uncomfortable/lumpy, and the linens did not fit the beds very well, so they would come off the mattresses while we slept. The beds were so bad that my mother and stepfather ended up taking turns sleeping on an air mattress because they could not both sleep in the bed on the first level at the same time. The AC was locked at 73, and the temperature in the rental varied wildly between being extremely hot and very cold. All of the curtains were sheer so it was very difficult to sleep in as light would start coming in as soon as the sun started to rise. 

Additionally, the neighborhood the rental is in is a pain in the butt to get into; the guard gate will require that you stop and hand over the license of the driver before they will let you in (even if you are using an uber). This often resulted in a long wait if multiple people who are renting try to come in. There was also very little consistency in the check in process at the gate; sometimes we were waved through without a second glance, other times they wanted to verify in the computer that we were allowed to enter and we were stuck waiting for several minutes. We mostly used Ubers and Lyfts, and the drivers were frequently stuck at the gate waiting despite me calling ahead and letting them know to expect them. One night my husband and I came back around 1 am after a date night, and the guard gate was unmanned despite us knocking and calling, so our uber could not get into the complex. We had to get out and walk around the gate to get home, which completely defeats the purpose of having a guard gate in the first place!

REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Beautiful house exactly as described. Make sure you park next to the house and not in front of the hot tub!

Love the expansive sliding door across the front of the house- the views alone are amazing!

Hot tub- great! Beware- you will have to walk on gravel to get from the tub to the house- bring some sandals or crocs etc. I cut my foot the first night. 

The management company was very fast to respond- once because our internet went out and again because the hot tub started smelling. Both times the customer service was awesome.

One small con- the bedroom is at least 10 degrees hotter than the living room. Make sure you turn down the heat during the evening/night.

One big con- the bed. The first night my husband woke up with the worst neck pain and each night got worse. The last 2 nights I had horrible back pain. DON'T try the couch bed. lol

All in all- well worth it- this house was private but close to Sugar and has everything you need for a great time.

REVIEW: 
The Good: For our trip, this house functioned as we needed. We were attending a conference in downtown Atlanta & this was within a 10 min drive & was large enough for our group. You can tell they have put work into the property & it's not a bad place today. We even talked about possibly staying there again.

The Bad: 3 leaks in the ceiling, under furniture was gross, inside door closing issues, wet/slippery bathroom floors, dryer was SUPER squeaky, water seeping in under exterior back door, etc.

The UGLY: 3 of our people arrived early, 2 of them being police officers. When they arrived 1 of them sat on a wicker chair, and it collapsed. Then during the evening someone simply sat on another wicker chair, and it collopased. There was no horseplay or anything rough with them. They simply sat down and the broke & the corn hole board I leaned up against a wall & a leg broke. I tried to contact the owner to try & tell him some of the issues we had & explain the chair to try and help him as we were some of his first renters but he was not wiling to talk to me on the phone-& the list was long enough I was not going to sit there and text him. He then proceeded to charge me over 500$ in damages. I tried to speak w/ him but he wasn't willing to communicate.

If they can fix the leaks & have actual beds(not air mattresses) for people this is a great place. But be aware, they will charge you for anything and not speak to you about your stay.

Chris was supposed to meet us on check in. He didn’t. Security was supposed to have our name and supply a garage door opener. That was not the case. The condo was not well maintained. It was not clean and the bedding was grungy and there was dog poop on the balcony. In addition there was no Tv, microwave or blender. Chris said there had been a theft, the former tenant had broken the TV and the maid had resigned. To his credit he did bring a Tv, bought some new bedding and came to wash windows, but this should have been done before our arrival. We discovered the dishwasher did not work and one of the toilets worked only sometimes. Chris expected us to use our vacation time to have the work completed. He told us he had arranged for a cleaning lady to clean the whole condo. We waited all day and she did not show up. He gave a number of excuses for not being available. First he fell, then he was involved in a car accident and then his phone was stolen. It strains credulity to believe a real estate agent did without a phone for two weeks. The
Other issue which was concerning was the fact that the balcony door did not close. Chris supplied two metal poles when we expressed our concern. He obviously was not on good terms with the security staff or the condo administration and we were told that he was the subject of a discussion aa meeting of the condo board. We heard more but will not repeat what we do not know first hand. Think twice before you book this condo

REVIEW: 
The owners have updated the property, but the cleaners or Prop Managers are not doing a good job. The upstairs shower/tub was unusable due to a moldy oversized shower curtain that covers 1/2 of the tub. Easy fix but no one took the time to shorten the liner. Buying 25 new pillows (+ more Dollar tree plastic flowers) does not make the living room furniture more comfortable or safe. The legs on the Living & dining room chairs are broken or about to break. HAZARD!! The down stair return air vent is beyond filthy! GAG. Slip shod cleaners left crumbs in the window seat cushions, coffee stains on the counter, dried food in the dish drainer, and the oven had red sauce all over inside. The back door inside mat had large ugly stains. Someone should clean the pull out garbage tray! You need to be forth coming on the steep stairs if you rent to families with children or older adults. No pull on the pocket door down stairs. We could see the owners had remodeled the kitchen, added new windows, vaulted the ceiling and refinished the floors. I'm sorry they placed their trust in poor management. We have vacationed with VRBO for 15+ years, So we expected much better. So disappointing. 
We took pictures if you are interested in seeing what we saw.

REVIEW: 
Overall, This was a very well kept house and very convenient for our family. We booked this property because of location, amenities, and the pool. About 10 days prior to arrival I read a review that stated the pool was broke. I reached out to inquire and was told the owner has scheduled it to be fixed, with no date commitment. The previous renter was given a credit so I was not overly concerned. We show up and of course the pool is still broken, and drained except for about 1 foot of water at bottom, and no cover. Having small children with us made this dangerous and kept us from enjoying the lanai. When asked about the credit, Remax refused, and when I pushed back, received no response as to why. Also know that Remax will take a security deposit that is as much as a weeks rental and hold it for nearly two months. I did accept these terms, so caveat emptor. If you put this on a credit card, the interest can add up. I liked the property, but will never deal with a Remax managed property on VRBO again.

REVIEW: 
We did not notice that the two bedrooms were upstairs. My wife has mobility difficulties because of back injuries, and she found the stairs hard to climb. This is NOT William's fault - we should have asked more questions! Kitchen equipment was excellent. Justin was very helpful. We did not have wifi or phone connections in Costa Rica. We did not receive instructions on how to check in to the property before we arrived at the address, but we met up with Jus within a few minutes of visiting the Coastal Property Management office.

REVIEW: 
Driveway was barely cleared. So narrow we could not get in. Could not even open doors to unload. Slipped and fell several times. We damaged our car pretty bad. Hired our own snow plow the following day to come help us ($40.00). 

All decks covered in snow several feet high. You couldn’t even sit outside or walk around safely. 

Photos make the place look way bigger than it really is. 

All the other places around us were cleared for easy parking and accessibility. 

Driveway is also steep. 

Overall takeaway not a safe place to stay.

The listing was for a king, queen and twin beds. There was a king bed and two bedrooms with twin beds in each of them. Totally misleading property....I don't recommend this to anyone.

A casa é bem estruturada, espaçosa, tem duas geladeiras e um freezer horizontal novos, conta com uma funcionária, Cleide, simpática, cozinha muito bem, a ela só elogios. O caseiro que deveria cuidar da limpeza externa e piscina, mal o víamos durante nossa estada. A casa necessita de uma reforma ampla, as camas são box, porém só tem uma espuma que vem na cama, ou seja, não tem colchão, as noites foram muito mal dormidas. Nas suítes inferiores não tem janela de ventilação, em uma determinada noite caiu um pedaço do forro de gesso, quase atingiu uma criança que dormia. No anuncio consta como 7 suítes e na verdade são 6 suítes e um closed que foi considerado como quarto. Pegamos dois dias de chuva, ai apareceram várias infiltrações pela casa, quando utilizávamos a churrasqueira era goteira pra tudo que é lado. No anuncio constava que água, energia e internet faz parte do aluguel, porém o proprietário queria nos cobrar R$300,00 por um caminhão pipa de água potável, isso gerou um stress devido as várias mensagens que recebi nos cobrando essa conta. Por fim, após uma ampla reforma a casa Boedo se tornará atrativa, mas antes que isso aconteça não recomendo.

It served it's purpose, butwas below par. The location is good close to stores, rest. And fishing.
Living room: the couch if you sat on it you fell into it getting out was difficult. The tv screen was filthy, no cable just roku w/o password to stream. No welcome book most vrbos have to tell you how to work things etc. The floor is soft in places, warped and uneven, so are some of the walls.
Stove is uneven pan on top with egg and egg slides to the back, had to find a board to level the back. Handle to oven real.loose and wont broil. Sink sprayer wont spray. Pan in cupboard was covered in grease. Very few silverware, 
cooking utensils, or pans. 
Back door is very difficult to open, no lights out back.
Bbq burners were burnt through and could not use it.

We arrived to dirty dishes in the sink, dirty dishes in the dishwasher, a sink drain full of rotten food, and the garbage disposal smelled horrible. The beds had dirty sheets on them; we had TO WASH THE LINENS before we could sleep! Dirty bathrooms with hair and dirt in the sinks and shower. The shower was full of mold and did not drain. Floors were unclean; if you walked around without socks, your feet were black. The counters and floors are full of dried and nasty food and dog hair. Dirty dishes in the cabinets and old food that was dried. The property is unsafe; the baseboards are so bowed from the walls you trip. The stair railing is broken, and my son fell down the stairs. The smoke detector has not been checked since August 2012, and the attic door does not close bad cold drafts. The linens are dirty, towels provided are the tiny and towels from Walmart that still had ""inspection"" stickers on them and would not even fit around my 12-year-old. The bathroom floors have mold and a thick layer of nasty hair and dirt around the sides. If you try to contact the property management company, the voicemail is full. When they finally emailed us on day 3, they did not provide a refund for the trip. The house is in a good location, but the house is so nasty and in disrepair, I WOULD NOT STAY HERE!

REVIEW: 
The property offers a lot. The grounds are kept up perfect. A leaf dare not drop and it is swept up by the hard working gardener. The chef is delightful and made us lunch and dinner every day. You chose what you want on the menu the day before. There were a few miscommunications but all in all it went nicely. There is a helper to serve and bar tend, he was sweet and took great care of our margarita needs. He even led our group on a great hike to a waterfall. One of the highlights of the trip for the grandsons. They jumped off rocks into the river. The housekeeper kept the rooms clean and tidy everyday. My group said it exceeded their expectations and loved being right on the beach and having our own grounds. The boys loved learning to boogie board in the waves and warm sea water. There are boogie boards, pool toys, a ping pong table and kayaks too. Plus they supply life jackets. I loved listening to the waves crashing every night putting me to sleep. I had the window open all night and never needed the AC. I did get bites on my legs as I did not even use a sheet. I think there is a tiny bug called No See UM's. I got bit by those last year in Puerto Vallarta too. They itch like the devil. 
There are a few details that could be tended to. Like hooks on the back of bathroom doors, plastic covers taken off the lamps, a hand rail on the stairs going to the beach. But, those are very minor. You will not regret staying at Casa Mucumba. It is a beautiful.

I read a few previous reviews about the residence being difficult to access. This is not that case at all. concrete all the way until you reach the property then it is nice gravel. Will stay here again! If your looking for a gorgeous place to stay and have a few guests that are looking to nestle next to the fire, soak in the hottub or use the amazing kitchen for home cooked meals this is the place and at a descent price!

TITLE: 
would not recommend!
REVIEW: 
To Whom It May Concern: 
A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.

REVIEW: 
Cute room and a great full kitchen with fridge and dishwasher. I needed to check in a little early and they were able to accommodate which I really appreciated. 
The blankets had some junk on them and because I’m a bit of clean freak I had to put some sheets over them, but it might just have been overlooked since I checked in early. 

Some notes for other guests:
1. The parking is thru a very skinny driveway so do not attempt a full SUV or other extra large vehicle (mini suv or full size sedan is fine)
2. Steps down to the space are a bit steep (and dark at night) and the handrail is unfinished- have a flashlight or phone to see at night and if you have mobility challenges maybe find a different room

Other than this it was an amazing experience! I do however feel housekeeping is doing a mediocre job! Ceiling fans need cleaned, hand rail n stairs have a lot of built up dirt! The hot tub also was not clear water! This home deserves to be cleaned better!

terrible snow removal
REVIEW: 
It had not snowed in the 2-3 days prior to our stay. The snow plows had come through after they had plowed the parking area, and they did not clean up the mound of snow at the end of the driveway. Our vehicle got stuck trying to get into the parking area, and we had to shovel the ice snow out. Worse than that, they only cleared off the snow on half of the steps, and that half was ice covered with no salt. It was also the side WITHOUT the railing, so there was nothing to hold onto as you climbed 2 stories of very slippery steps. One of my friends ended up falling. There was no salt on the property to help with the situation. We called and requested them to be shoveled and salted that night. No one came to take care of it until 1pm the following day. The back deck with the hot tub was not shoveled at all. We had to shovel it to be able to use the hot tub. There was no propane barbecue on the property, as was advertised. The house was clean except for the grease and animal hair on the waffle maker. The key was supposed to be located “to the right of the door”. A more accurate description would have been ‘on the handle of the garage door’. The manager did answer my phone calls and assisted, I was just VERY disappointed with the lack of snow removal (and failure to rectify it in a quick amount of time) and no propane grill on the property as was advertised.

worst experience with a vbro rental ever
REVIEW: 
1.Problems with check in. Locks didn't work, help was a call center in India and took over 30 minutes to get access to the house and they wanted me to troubleshoot their dead battery in the lock..
2. Issues with gate pass, had to get a pass daily from guard instead Ed of getting a pass for our entire stay.
3. No welcome kit with access to resort amenities. The ad said we would have access to resort amenities but after a very long and confusing text exchange with AvantStay we were told, nope, no access to amenities. They suggested that we just go to the amenities center and see if we could get in-like jump the fence.
4. House smelled bad.
5. Lied on advertising- no access to resort amenities, no outdoor dining, no deck, no outdoor living space.
6. Hidden fees and surprise charges after hitting book.
7. WiFi was so slow, we didn't use it.
8. Furniture was uncomfortable/unusable except for the beds. 
9. Garage doors didn't open.
10. Banister caps all loose and falling off safety hazard.
11. No resort information.
12. I spent entirely too much of my time texting with AvantStay instead of enjoying my family.

The house was well appointed and maintained. Everything was very clean. We had a bit of trouble finding the house initially, but eventually found it. Some posts have said that you can walk down to the resort below in the marina, but that walkway is locked off with a gate. The house could use some books on St Croix. The pool could use hand rails to get in, given the steps are really steep. Great coffee set up - an neurogenic machines, a regular coffee maker, a grinder and even a milk foamer! We enjoyed a drink at the Buccaneer Lounge and a snorkeling trip with Llewelyn on a catamaran. Duggans Reef and Great Salt Pond were wonderful dinners. Shoy beach is nice and quiet but it was too windy to snorkel there.

great location -- not a comfortable stay
REVIEW: 
I'll start with the positive: the house is a great location. We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak! 

The net is I would not stay here again.

TITLE: 
disappointing, dangerous and stress-inducing
REVIEW: 
The cabin itself was fine and matched the photos. However, there were some details that made us wish we had just gotten a hotel. Properties like this are the epitome of the poor STR offerings that are now commonplace.

First: This property is managed by a professional company. It is weird and inconvenient that they require guests to have to first visit an offsite location during their available office hours to check-in.

Second, the amount of messages and forms we were subject to after booking was dizzying. Once we had already booked and paid on VRBO, we were forced to fill out pages of additional forms via links with extra signatures and personal information, and then fill that information again in-person during check-in. They even prompted us to install another additional app altogether just for a 2-night stay. There were house rule sheets fed to us at every turn: in the emails, forms, on printouts, on the contracts, hanging in the home. I felt unwelcome by the end of it. The point is: booking through VRBO should be the sole source of our registration info and the house rules. All this extra stuff felt very unwelcoming.

Third: the home entrance itself was difficult to access. I wish I could post a photo, because the narrow stairs leading to the front door had at least a 3-inch thick later of slippery ice on top. It was almost comical how difficult it was to walk up the steps without assistance. We had to tag-team bringing in our bags because it was so dangerous to walk up. We couldn't have dealt with the ice if we'd wanted: all they provided was a cheap plastic snow shovel that couldn't come close to busting the ice. I can't believe they didn't clear the walkway and salt the steps before admitting guests.

Fourth: the instructions call for guests to take their garbage to the dump, after charging a cleaning fee! As paying guests (and as a short-term rental host myself), I had to laugh that these people require their guests to go run errands for them around town just to go check out. These hosts are a local company -- they can go make the garbage run to the dump themselves.

Needless to say, we won't be coming back to Big Bear anytime soon and I do not recommend Big Bear Vacations.

gas leaks through out the property that were not fixed
REVIEW: 
We stayed in this rental January 20-23. We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

REVIEW: 
The Bad : The first thing is either add a window or list this as what it is a Basement. Secondly if you expect the noise ordinance to be upheld by the renters then the owners should as well. There is no reason I should be woken up bulg what I can assume only to be as a morning ballet lesson followed by a fashion runway in cement heels. Next the bathroom while it is gorgeous definitely need to be looked at. The sink is entirely to small and there is a strange sewer smell that lingers in the bathroom. The internet was great on my devices but the TV is so old that it can't keep up with the wifi so watching anything that was streamed constantly buffered or flat out got stuck loading. Speaking of the TV half of the TV is darkened and will SOON be out. Next the lighting going down to the property is also dangerous there needs to be more closer to the door. The bamboo on steps needs to be trimmed back, I should not have to walk around it to use the stairs. Speaking of stairs, I understand it may not rain a lot in LA but it did when I was visiting and the most dangerous thing is wet wood as steps with no grip, they became dangerously slippery with how steep the steps are. Lastly a trash can NEEDS to be added, yes I know you have the tiny trash can big enough for receipts below the sink but that's clearly not enough.

The Good : very beautiful neighborhoods. The furniture in the room was all very well crafted and clean. The studio itself was also very clean. The lighting in the apartment was very nice. The bathroom was very nice for a one person as well. Accessibility to the neighborhood were very easy and great for finding food and other things.

My grade would be. 2.5/5

This cozy townhome was perfect for our weekend at Beech Mountain. It was a close (less than 5 min) drive to the mountain, easy to access, and had everything we needed to cook all of our meals. The view is absolutely incredible and it was nice to just curl up by the fireplace and take in the view. I have reduced my rating by 1 star because the interior stairs of this home are quite steep. The height of the risers were higher than your average staircase and although there is a handrail, it is also higher than normal taking more effort to reach for.

REVIEW: 
The house is cute and clean. The pic of the house listed, appears to be in the woods. It is not in the woods. It is on the main st. In Government Camp. You have to park in front of the house, if there is a place to park. Then you have to be up by 7:30 to get dressed and move your car to the other side of the street. You do this daily. This was not mentioned on vrbo. You find this out when you arrive and read the book. If you don’t read the book, you will most likely get a ticket. 
On the first night we were woken up around 1:30 a.m. to what sounded and felt something like a bad earthquake, followed by beep, beep, beep, beep and the process repeated until around 3:30 a.m. Turned out to be snowplows. 
We asked host to give us money back for second night so we could leave, but he would not. Said we knew where the house was located. I had never been up there before, so no I didn’t know anything about it. Ad says steps to town, but for someone who hasn’t been there before and by looking at the pic of the house you would never know you are on the main st. 
People should know that they will have to get up to move car back and forth daily and that during snows, you will be awake for hours, unless you are a very deep sleeper. 
The lighting in minimal.
The stair case if very narrow and dark for coming down to use the bathroom at night. We had to use our cell phone flashlight. If we knew about moving car daily and snowplows we would not have booked.

great beach location
REVIEW: 
Our family of 5 recently stayed at this home (we have 3 older teens). The home decor was really unique and fun, and the outdoor space was great to relax in. The huge feature of this house was its proximity to the beach - just a 2 min walk and we had the beach to ourselves at times. Simply beautiful. The guest welcome guide online was great for getting us all the info we needed for check-in and check-out. Communication with the owners was extremely quick prior to our check-in, but once we arrived it slowed down. There were too many items to note for maintenance for me to give this 5 stars. The comforter in the Elton bedroom was stained/dirty, the fan ticked and a phone in the utility closet beeped every two minutes. We also had dust and dead flies under the chairs which we cleaned up. A kitchen drawer was missing the front panel and handle, and the dining room light fixture was missing a glass globe. The bunk room is quite small, as is the black/gold bathroom. There are two steps easily seen from the kitchen down to a door leading outside, but then there's another step beyond that which we all tripped down (it's all black tile) so be careful of that. The pool and hot tub were perfect. The showers in the two larger bathrooms were great. Beds need mattress pads (only a thin sheet between you and the mattress). But the vibe and location to the beach was top notch. I communicated the items that needed to be addressed and did receive an apology and a thanks so they can address for future guests. Unfortunately, it was enough to make the person in the Elton room uncomfortable for the entire stay. Bring bug spray (mosquitos are out). Hoping this home gets a little TLC for future guests.

This great retreat was central to all we wanted to do: PhD graduation, visiting family, swimming with manatees, St. Augustine, and DWorld. If you want to just visit all the amusement areas this house would be perfect - we went 1 day and came home for naps, lunch, and a swim before we headed back - it took us about 15min maybe less.

Main room is downstairs, we recommend slides or slippers for the stairs as the no-fall configuration of them hurts your feet until your used to them. We weren't used to glass tables and were happy to find, and use placemats! 

Doordashing was our dinner go too - so many great places around. Food was always hot - we did have a full fridge which was great.

Swimming and hottubing every day next to a lake was heavenly!! Worth the extra fee for sure.

REVIEW: 
Overall it was a great experience. The line for Northstar when driving from the property was very short. If you come from the other direction you wait for hours. It has plenty of room and things to do for the kids, area to play, games, pool table etc. the fireplace is nice and warms the house up. For the most part we had everything we needed. A few things that could have been better, these are small things and just would have been nice. There were no paper towels, there were not enough towels for the hot tub (only 2). The sheets on the master bedroom bed are probably from 1990 and were worn out in 1995. They don’t stay on the bed even for a minute. There are extra pillows but no pillow cases anywhere. My husband hated the bed but I was fine. DO NOT bring anyone who may slip easily or who has trouble walking in the winter. We had to shovel the driveway to get the truck in (we have 4x4) and we had to shovel the stairs and walk to the door which was very steep and slippery. The trash cans in the bear box was overflowing so we couldn’t take our trash out. The back bedroom was freezing at night but we had plenty of blankets that we brought from home.

Check in time was not correct.
Cleaners arrived after us and was there an hour after the updated check in time.
Getting the correct address was challenging and when we did get the address it was 49 minutes away from the pin drop on this app. Luckily there was regular local buses. But it added extra cost and time. We picked this place based on its location so was disappointed. There is very little beach most of the time none at all due to the sea, the steps leading down to the water is unsafe as its cracked on both sides so you are unable to go into the water from this access point.
The whole place smells of damp we had to keep the aircon on to stop the bedrooms from smelling. Leaving cupboard doors open. 
The cleaners put damp smelling sheets on the beds and we were left with dirty towels.
The kitchen cupboards also smell and apart from the microwave/coffee maker/cooker all other appliances listed are there but all have stickers on them stating they do not work.
Kitchen equipment is old and mix match. No scissors etc.
My friend got an electric shock from the smallest bedroom. The bigger room the plugs would spark now and again same for the plug by the kitchen bar.
One bathroom completely unusable (toilet, shower and sink) the main bedroom shower would not drain properly.

Great Location minute walk to shops ,beach and parks.If you love to sit and people watch ,don't mind a bit of traffic this house is ideal,There is stairs to kitchen area so not recommend for people with injuries.Ideal for two seperate families as seperate sleeping areas.Like any two storey house downstairs bedroom can hear all movement upstairs.Furniture and beds are comfortable and modern and bonus to have two big screen tv's in the house,for those relax moments.The only thing i could say is the hill hoist could be replaced as we were very close to hitting our heads on the corners and was in the way.All is needed is another small stand alone clothes airer.

Please look and read all listings as this listing is without air conditioning for 1 they do provide 6 fans but only 4 of the 6 worked 1 also stopped working while we was there, we notified them is was to hot in the place and we have medical conditions, she said she would bring a fan but it would be several hour's, we did end up finding alterative arringments for my spouse because it was over 90 degrees in home and cooler outside and this was in cooler hawaii weather. A few nother thibgs to note was stains on the couch, dishes not clean, shower was gross and had dirt on grout lines on floor can tell stained and been there. Mold on the ceiling growing mold at that. This was un safe for family with allergies also. The tv upstairs was unplugged when got there and we plugged in and it kept turning on and off broken. There is no tv in the master bedroom also no fires suppression system in the bedroom its capped off and the copper pipes rinning threw the whole place made it look bad bormally these are barried in walls and not noticable. The kids wanted to use the pool but looked like older work out group all the time the residents are older keep that in mind when booking. There is no access to the water unless climb fence or rocks, this unit has parkong spot very small and hard to get into and lot it self not super big but this is minnor. If you arrive at night bring a flash light you have to go down a few stairs hard right then down about 4 or 5 more stairs and then walkway that that is very dark and thruthfully unsafe at night. Cant see walking bagage down and hard to get down stairs even thought the wreight of the bags are trully our fault then you have to take everything up 20 or so stairs to the unit. Very outdated furnishings. Wish we coule have got our money back and moved on because this because between the heat and the unsafe area all dark and the incurrd cost to get my spouse into a cooler place cost us just as much as the few days and atleast would have been cooler but we tuffed it out. Id recommened checking other places if possible and only choose this if you whilling to chance it.

REVIEW: 
Buyer beware. 
look elsewhere for your vacation stay. I stayed in this property with my family for a Christmas vacation and it was nothing short of a disaster. The cabin had a faulty breaker and left us without heat for multiple days. The weather was 5 degrees and a wind chill of below 10 degrees. We had two small children and it was unsafe to stay in the cabin. When we were finally able to reach the property managers we were told to book additional lodging and that we would be reimbursed. After checking out they revoked their written word. Owners didn’t properly reimburse for the time the cabin was down nor did they reimburse for the additional lodging we needed. They didn’t take responsibly for the issues that needed to be fixed in order to have a safe and warm stay. We spent so much money, just to have our family separated and without answers on Christmas. I wouldn’t recommend staying in any property they own or manage (Kaizen property’s). Apart from this the cabin is not fit for small children as it does not have safe stairways and railings. Save your self a headache and book elsewhere. You won’t regret it.

TITLE: 
lots of potential but poorly maintained.
REVIEW: 
My family flew in from Miami to ski. I thought I had got us an awesome spot to spend the weekend so we were quite excited. Once we got there we were let down, it’s a beautiful cabin with a great location but it’s poorly maintained and the listing on Vrbo is misleading. To start there was nothing in rental details saying that you cannot have a fire yet there is a fire place shown in the pictures and to be honest that’s part of going to a cabin in general especially when the weather is below 10 degrees outside it would be nice to use the fire place. Next we go up stairs and open all the blinds in the master bedroom to see the beautiful view before dark and we notice the bottom right window pane has a crack through it and the window was left open, then we see the top left pane is cracked and split in multiple locations which is almost dangerous if someone tried to operate that window. So I document all the stuff I had seen so far by taking pictures and notifying the maintenance company, then I am finally get settled and and ready to take a shower. I go up stairs to take a shower in the bathroom of the bedroom with the canopy bed and before I can even turn the handle for the water to come on the whole handle and wall plate fall off the wall so I couldn’t even use my own shower. I proceeded to go down stairs and use the other shower. Once I had finally showered I go to sit on the couch and play a game of cards with my family and I move one of the couch pillows which was hiding a huge stain on the leather cushion. I had contacted maintenance twice and they said they had made notes on the file and would be sending someone over to fix the shower Saturday morning, Saturday evening we arrive back at the house and the upstairs shower had still not been fixed. It was just one thing after another, we spent good money to be able to stay here and from the looks of the add on Vrbo it looks great from afar but to be charging what I was charged that place needs a lot of maintenance done.

unfavorable!
REVIEW: 
This is our 1st & only unfavorable VRBO review after many 5 star bookings. We vacated 2 days early due to poor conditions. 
The entrance was at the back, was dark, cluttered & had a crumbling cement stairs. Out front had bags of garbage and toilets to be disposed of for two days after we arrived. The living room had poor lighting, had missing bulbs & the room was still dark after they replaced a bulb. It was too dark to read a book without a flashlight. One sconce was hanging by wires off the wall. The floor was unfinished between the kitchen & living room causing a tripping hazard. The kitchen light didn't work causing us to have to use our cell phone flashlights to see. One hall light flickered the whole time it was on. The noisy sliding BR doors were very hard to open and close. There were no closets or hooks anywhere to hang clothes in the bedrooms or the entrance to hang a coat. There wasn't enough hot water to take a ""quick"" shower. The windows had bars, ""not pictured"" on the listing. The windows and curtains were filthy. The kitchen counters and coffee pot had not been cleaned. The kitchen had water stained & sagging ceiling tiles. We would, periodically, smell sewer gas.
We did communicate with the manager during our stay. They did address replacing a couple light bulbs, however, the rooms remained dark and no light in the kitchen. She was sending our complaint with pictures we took, to the owner however, we have not heard anything back from the owner even 5 days later which is careless on his part. We regret that we paid $896.57 for 5 nights.

worst rental experience yet- but comfy beds
REVIEW: 
I am a frequent VRBOer and this one was a first. I reached out via message and asked questions about the hot tub. Explained we were planning a ladies night out. My request said 5. Booking said max overnight 7. Shortly after arriving I received a message about “no unregistered guest”. And “no parties” I responded with it’s just a bunch of us ladies and I told you this is what we were reserving for. I said 2 more may stay and she then said well I have to charge you an additional $20. I mean I had been there an hour. Just trying to relax. All of us 33-50 year old moms!! We work in heath care! We needed to relax! I had to pay an additional $20
Which is just outrageous for the already $411 for the night. This woman does not know how to HOST and should not be a host. Also, the dust in the place was really bad in a ton of spots, the mold in the downstairs shower window was more than I could handle and the freaking hot tub! The reason we ended up with this one smelled terrible! Like mold. The 3 women who went in first came back smelling so bad we couldn’t take it. I have text messages about it the smell still the next day. Really nasty and she just responded with “it was refilled 4 days ago and has chemicals” sure didn’t smell like any chemicals just musty mold! Even the placemats at the table smelled like mold. Bottom line is we picked this house after lots of looking because of the layout. The kitchen, the table and the living room blend together and it was nice for conversation. Pretty and comfortable. I loved the clock. The back porch was cool
With the fire and would be awesome in summer. If you plan to rent this for yourself in town for the night or maybe 2 sure anything else you should expect to be harassed for someone’s past mistakes. Oh and forced to buy the $79 insurance plan that she swears is coming back to
Me. But to me that should have been enough for
Her but no. She needs to stop hosting. I’ll try and submit our messages screenshot for those who might think I’m over reacting 🤣. We had an awesome night after the hassle and the beds are really comfortable. The downstairs room is a little weird but nice and a huge washer dryer. Bathroom is up a step and then toilet is up another step down stairs so that’s no good for in the dark walking to the bathroom. Nightlights suggested. Please clean your hot tub. It is really really gross.

beautiful location
REVIEW: 
I truly loved this location. We wanted a quite area away from crowds and we got it. Very few beach walkers and no venders. Alberto was present and showed us up to our unit. We were on the top unit. There is a unit below us as well as a studio down the driveway. 

The unit was very clean and spacious. The kitchen is well-appointed. They had a water dispenser with large jugs and replaced as needed. Plenty of lounging furniture. The balcony had a table with 4 chairs. I would worn those with children that the spiral staircase to the second floor loft may be a hazard. For adults you must be careful when reaching the top...there are 2 beams you must go under and it's very easy to bump your head. Doable but you must be careful. I don't think there is a remedy due to the design of the unit but just be aware of those that will be sleeping in that area. 

There was a paddle board and two kayaks to use as well as several water toys for children and adults. We didn't use the pool due to the weather but it was kept very clean. The outdoor shower and hose was great to rinse off with. We had a housekeeper come three times for the week and he did a great job including doing the dishes.

We had Chef Beto come in twice. I highly recommend having the welcome dinner. We were tired of travel and it was perfect. Very devious and plentiful! We had leftovers for days! 

Christina was very prompt with her responses and very accommodating. She truly wanted to please us!

schönes ferienhaus im jagdhausstil, bedingt kleinkind geeignet
REVIEW: 
Wir haben einen wunderschönen, schneeweißen Familienurlaub im einsamen und sehr ruhigen Dolni Dvur verbracht. Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen.

slippery steps
REVIEW: 
The space I would describe as a suite in a hotel room. All the amenities that you could need in the kitchen and bathroom are provided. The fireplace in the living room is very tall making it rather awkward watching tv however the size of the TV rather makes up for that. The only thing that I can say negative about the space is the only accessible door is up a flight of wood steps that are exposed to the weather, making them very slick early in the morning. We had several people in our group slip down the stairs, one sliding all the way down causing extreme deep bruising on several parts of their body. So be very careful during cold weather going up and down.

TITLE: 
escape from a bad 2022 year on the mainland.
REVIEW: 
We were expecting to be closer to the Ocean. We estimate that it's 1/4 mile to the road past Brennecke's Beach Broiler. So we used the car daily to transport our stuff to the beach when we used the beach chair's.

The 2 Bedroom unit was larger than expected, well supplied, clean and quiet. The pool area is right outside the Living Room Lanai and noise was not at all an issue when others were using the pool and grilling area, etc...

The step down from the Dining area into to the Living Room has two 4"" steps over an distance of 8 feet wide. We found this to be a concern moving at night without lighting. so we placed one of the Dining Room chairs at the base of the steps to alert us to the steps in the dark.

I had a night cough, so we used both bedrooms and the smaller one seamed to have some type of lingering order we couldn't identify.

The grounds were beautiful and the trail to the beach areas easy to follow. Everything in the description of the property was accurate and we used the beach chairs several times. The refrigerator freezer worked well until the last day when we had to clean out the ice storage bin so fresh ice could be produced,

We also found two of the Coasters were broken in the Living room. We threw them out as they could not be used and purchased a matching set of four coasters which we left for future users.

Overall we would rate the property as a FIVE!

TITLE: 
wheelchairs, poor maintenance & no front desk help
REVIEW: 
The property itself was nice but maintenance had been neglected. The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us.

Beautiful and large condo with a gorgeous location right on the beach. It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.

Vrbo wont assist since we didn’t leave property (there was nowhere else to stay). 

This property is for sale and obvious the owner no longer cares.

This spot was perfect for our family of five. Check in was a little old school with a lock box attached to a door- but it was easy to get in. The home was well stocked with anything you could possibly need. We loved the goodies provided, especially the local soap and tea! We spent the afternoon watching the wildlife in the backyard- turkeys in the trees, and deer meandering by. The house was super comfortable, and the natural light was amazing. The toys provided kept our children more than entertained. The library of books was amazing! Our only concern is that there was no handrail on the stairs, and my husband hurt his knee because of it. The hosts sent great communication via text, but we didn’t hear back from them when we requested a late check out (which is totally fine). All in all, the Chickadee chalet was perfect for our family and we would love to stay here again.

TITLE: 
unique, art-infused townhouse in an amazing location but mind the stairs
REVIEW: 
My husband and I loved the Forsythe House. It’s very unique and not your typical beach rental. The space has a very cool vibe and we loved the views from the roof, over the park and the record player was also a great touch. There is lots of glass throughout so we didn’t love the fish bowl effect especially in the evening where people passing by can see everything (no curtains on the first floor). Seeing out to the view over the park was lovely. But people seeing right back in wasn’t my favorite. (I know, you can’t have it both ways). We also loved that it was pet friendly. No complaints about this house at all .. we’ve already recommended it to some friends. However, if you have small kids or a small dog, I wouldn’t recommend it. The “floating stairs” in the house are aesthetically cool, but not safe for kids or dogs in my opinion. They aren’t just open at the riser, but they don’t have an attached railing with gaps of several inches between the tread and the wires they used for the railing. We had to carry our dog up and down. Just a small price to pay to reach the beautifully decorated bedrooms and amazing roof top deck. The roof top is another stellar feature and we enjoyed several sunsets up there but had to hold our dog in our lap or keep him on a short leash because the railings are very open. The location on Ruskin Square is stunning and we will 100% stay here again if we aren’t traveling with pets. Management was great and we really loved the location and the vibe.

One of the only reasons we chose to stay here and not our usual place we book for ski vacations was because it offered a hot tub which was broken the entire stay and host just kept sending someone and explaining to me process to fix it.

I wish it was disclosed as not suitable for children under 7 as other properties do. The “4th bedroom” was a bed in the open loft area no privacy and finally the cleanliness was very disappointing, very dusty floors carpets not vacuumed with dead flies on them sticky handles etc sinks and toilets not properly disinfecting among other issues

worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Our stay was beautiful short and sweet. We came in for a 1 night stay because I was visiting my sister in Hobby Unit Prison which is 40 min away.
2 hours before we checked in the property manager called me personally to let me know that the unit I originally wanted (The Starling) was having problems with electricity and that the lights were not working.
He gave me the choice of two of treehouses and I chose the CedarWaxling.
All and all I am happy with our stay despite moving cabins. 
It has everything you need , there is no oven but I did see two electrical hot plates under the sink so if you need something hot you can make a small breakfast or lunch.
Has microwave, plates, keirig with coffee pods, plates, glasses and mugs. 
They thought of everything.!!!

good house and location with caveats
REVIEW: 
This house was quite nice for our group of seven that stayed here for a weekend. View was beautiful from the dining and living room, as well as the kitchen. The rest of the house furniture wise was a little dated but comfortable. This house is about a 2 minute drive to the ski lodge at appalachian ski mountain where our children were taking ski lessons this weekend. 

Our main issue for the house was its exterior condition. This house is located close to the top of the Appalachian mountain Ski resort which is often blowing snow, and some of that snow may blow back on the property. In addition, it had snowed a few days prior. When we arrived, the driveway was not plowed, and with the temps jumping above and below 32 degrees it quickly became very slick. We could not pull one of our cars out of the driveway as a result, and the walkway to the entrance was also covered in snow and became pretty slick (one of our members slipped on the way in). The next day one of us had to shovel and salt the driveway ourself to give a chance for our subaru to make it out. 

On top of this, the thermostat was set to 50 degrees when we arrived, and took overnight to warm up the whole house to 70. We had to keep our 2, 4, and 6 year old in their jackets the rest of the evening to keep them warm. My father in law also tried calling the number provided for the owner but never received a call back. 

When I contacted the owner via the vrbo app they indicated that it is hard to keep up with the snow at all times, and so the driveway and walkway may not be cleaned. They also said that they control the heat remotely via wifi so that perhaps there was a connection issue. 

Regardless, for folks who are making decisions in the future on where to stay, just note that these may be things that you might have to deal with after arrival during the winter season. Had we known that we would have to clean the driveway, we would have saved the expense and just stayed in a hotel.

REVIEW: 
Property has a great location. House could be truly wonderful but the upkeep and cleanliness were terrible. The whole house was not cleaned PROPERLY to start. Food was found on the floor, a smoking pipe was found out on the outside deck by the table (left it there), there was dog poop on the outside of the slider door (left it there), air vents were just covered in dust/debris, bathrooms were the worst with mold & mildew on the tiles and glass doors. To me it seems like a property management issue but regardless the overall feel of the property was definitely not as described. Also, the games downstairs were not very inviting as the shuffle board was all ripped up, the pool table felt was very old.....again, not was represented on the listing. Anyway, we were only there 2 nights and made the best of it and honestly I did not want the hassle of dealing with everything above and ruining the little time we had. The house could be a wonderful place but the care and treatment of it has been neglected for a long time.

Un séjour tout a fait représentatif de l'idée que l'on peut se faire des joies de la montagne. C'est d'abord un site exceptionnel, un petit chalet en bois entouré par la forêt, avec des biches qui viennent le soir tout près de votre porte. Le chalet par lui même est parfait, très cosy, intimiste avec une décoration raffinée sans ostentation. Vous aurez aussi le plaisir de pouvoir utiliser un jacuzzi au milieu de la neige avant de vous relaxer dans le sauna attenant. Quant aux propriétaires, disponibilité, efficacité et sympathie les caractérisent ; au final, ce sont des amis que nous avons rencontré. Nous recommandons vivement ce châlet, agréable aussi bien en hiver qu'en été. Nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir !

REVIEW: 
The property and house itself were OK. The outside landscaping was pretty trashed. Lots of down brush and such. No grooming of the yard.
Bathroom was gross. Mildew and grime in all the corners, hair stuck to the walls, dead bugs on the vents, soap scum partially wiped off the shower walls, mildew all around the window sealer. Bedroom had a freestanding AC unit- the vent to the window was cracked in 3 places. Cracks were attempted to be fixed with dish towels, zip ties and duct tape. Lots of dead bugs and dust around the vent/window area.
Lots of spiders in the kitchen, randomly throughout the stay we would see spiders on the walls and ceilings.
When attention was brought to the owner of the issues his reply was ""this is due to the age of the house"".
Since when is CLEANING your house have anything to do with the age? You can have an old house and keep it clean!
When I asked for a cleaning fee refund he said that's not possible.
STAY AWAY.

TITLE: 
worst vrbo stay ever
REVIEW: 
This is the worst VRBO experience we have ever had. First of all, I consistently received two emails for every reminder and every check in one from Austin vacay and one from a service manager. This made the check in process difficult because the code sent to me did not work. I called the property manager who answered after the second call and gave me a different number which worked. They apartment in our opinion was not at all how was presented on the website. The furniture and art is different (no big deal). The outside door frame is completely rotted away, the kitchen cabinet and drawers do not close. There is black mold in the air vents. On almost every door inside and out is chipping and peeling paint. They lid on the toilet is broken and clearly glued together. The apartment smells very strongly of odor ban cleaning solution and as it wears off you can smell cigarette smoke. The units around this apartment all have broken blinds and loud barking dogs (I know the property manager can't control the neighbors, but something that would have been nice to know). Both times I contacted the property manager (check in and when we wanted to talk about the property) I had to call twice before he would answer. Needless to say, we left the property and ended up getting a hotel. I called the property owner and explained our concerns, he was not willing to refund any of the money except the cleaning fee, which I still have not had returned to me. Had this been a cheap rental I wouldn't have cared so much but as you can clearly see if you're considering it, it isn't cheap.

TITLE:

REVIEW: 
Lights missing from the overhang to see to get in the front door and then lights missing to see to get into the third floor unit. This was not an ideal way to start vacation. Owner needs to install proper lighting as a skylight does not work in the dark. Ceiling fan in master bedroom is hanging out of the ceiling, which is a safety issue. Grill cannot be used as it has not been cleaned in years and is falling apart. No umbrellas around the pool. They only have the rusted out bases left. Cushions for the outdoor chairs are falling apart. Towel rack in guest bath is pulling away from the wall. No remote to the TV in one of the guest bedrooms, therefore unusable. Old broken light in the corner of the bedroom that just needs to be removed. The ceiling fan in the living room has all of the lightbulbs broken out of it and unusable. The entry door to the unit needs a fresh coat of paint as it has lots of wear and tear. The kitchen is nice, but who really uses a kitchen that much on vacation? The location is great. I really, really wanted this place to be nice as I paid a premium rate for it. The main photo they use to get you to book the property is not what you get. No patio furniture around the pool. Only rusted umbrella bases and rusted chairs. The pool heater does not work, so you cannot swim unless it is very warm in Florida. I am emailing the owner my photos that support these statements and I hope they will invest in their property.

REVIEW: 
There are holes everywhere, in the roof in the foundation the gaps under the doors, it is a miracle it is not overrun with rodents. No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds. We would have turned around on our first day if we could get a refund! 
As it was we left early.

This property is in a great location close to town and in a quiet neighborhood. It has a very well equipped kitchen and was very clean. The beds were comfortable. The lighting, however, was terrible. It was impossible to read in the evenings: there were no table or floor lamps. The driveway had no lighting.
The property was supposed to have garage and laundry access, but it was locked. 
The snow and ice had not been removed from the deck and home entrance before our arrival or during our stay and was very slippery. We had no access to a shovel. 
Importantly, when I contacted management regarding this, their response was not helpful.
I would stay at this property again, if the lighting issue was resolved. I think in winter months that snow removal for safety should be a priority.

REVIEW: 
Had a great stay at this property for 5 guests on a ski trip to Fernie. The house is very large and spacious and a bit eclectic. Kitchen is stocked for pretty much anything you could imagine. Even a proper tray for baguettes. Large open living room and dining room with fireplace make it great for relaxing/game night. The back entrance is perfect for skis and boots. This is also where the sauna is and exit to the hot tub. Very nice the house was stocked with trash bags and paper towel as this can be rare with rentals.
While the washer and dryer happened to be on the fritz, the host was great with communication and helping give solutions to have any clothes washed/dried while we were there. Parking was ample and salt provided for the snow that did fall for the stairs. There are 2 showers and the master has a tub with a shower wand. The master also has a balcony to ""lord over"" the main living room.
The turret was great to get 360 mountain views. The house was about a 15-20 min walk to the downtown area but all streets are well lit. Would recommend and stay again.

schönes ferienhaus im jagdhausstil, bedingt kleinkind geeignet
REVIEW: 
Wir haben einen wunderschönen, schneeweißen Familienurlaub im einsamen und sehr ruhigen Dolni Dvur verbracht. Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen.

TITLE: 
worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!! 


RENTER BEWARE!!!!!

REVIEW: 
The property is small inside, which was indicated. And we love that it is dog friendly. 
My standard of clean is high, especially at this rental price. That being said, the unit is old, but I don't expect to see mold and mildew on the shower head, shower walls, bathroom flooring, shower curtain and walls where there is no trim pieces (broken off)
 Also, the kitchen faucet leaked the entire time leaving a trail of water constantly on the countertop. 
I bought mildew remover and Lysol and dried the shower curtain regularly to stave off the smell and growth.
Some owner updates would seriously improve these issues for future rentals.

bien situé, agréable mais des petites choses à revoir
REVIEW: 
J'espère vivement que les petits points négatifs seront corrigés afin que je puisse revenir l'année prochaine.
Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle
Les 2 lits de l'alcôve sont HS.
Les serviettes de toilette mériteraient d’être renouvelées.
Il faudrait rajouter une glace (par exemple entre Wc et Sd’eau où l’on puisse se voir en entier
1 coup de peinture sur les murs serait la touche finale pour un appartement quasi parfait.

amazing house for a group of friends + dog friendly + great location!
REVIEW: 
Highly recommend this property if you have a close group of friends with pups looking for a great Tahoe weekend. So close to the casinos/restaurants and Heavenly ski resort. The communication was so easy and they always picked up whenever I needed anything. The backyard was great for the pups to play in the snow. 

One thing I'd suggest is having the walk way to the door on the porch cleared of ice before check-in because it can be a little slippery when the ice freezes over. Overall, great stay!

TITLE: 
great location not much else
REVIEW: 
Upon arrival we were happy with the location. It was minutes away from everything we needed to do and only 30 mins from the quarter. But we chose this location so all the kids could enjoy being outside and away from the winter weather. The door to the back door was locked, one of the access points had a stump so we couldn't get in the back and the other gate was blocked. I messaged the owner and asked if we could use the back since there was nothing barring us from using it in the listing. We had to lift kids over and climb over to use the back yard. We moved the camera so it still pointed at the street but wasn't on the kids playing and the owner messaged us asking us to put it back. We were so uncomfortable we didn't let the kids go back outside. Truly made us feel like criminals Garage had a huge hole in the roof. Nothing provided to cook with other than pots, no spatulas cooking sheetc ECT,. The outlets in most of the house didn't work. There were sparks coming from the ones in the master bed and the only outlet that did work in there was falling out of the wall. Jets in the tub in the master bath didn't work. In the other bathroom the outlets didn't work, both tubsand stand up shower didn't drain, had standing water, and had black gunk coming from the drains and one of the overhead lights/fans didn't work. Heat settings were at 64° block so we were all freezing. Broken glass littered the flower pots. Laundry room was locked off from being used (we had babies with us). We had to buy our own cleaning products because the owner said there was some but we couldn't find it.

Accommodation is beautiful and location perfect! We have stayed here twice now and each time was a wonderful experience. Very responsive property management, including having the snow promptly shoveled in the driveway and walkway even as 30 inches fell while we were there! Gorgeous broad view up the hill out the back glass doors. So enjoyed relaxing in front of the wood fire - plenty of wood provided in the enclosed garage. Location is 20min from Big Sky resort and within 10 min of lots of good restaurants. Having stayed higher and lower on the mountain, we think this is absolutely the best spot. We sure hope to come back to this lovely home again and again.

Easy to get to from anywhere in Missoula, and being on the south end of town it was easy to get down the valley to Lolo Hot Springs. Loved having the grocery store nearby and a few near by treats like Massage Envy and some restaurants. The deck space is amazing. Would love to stay in summer to take advantage of the grill and outdoor space.

log cabin in the woods
REVIEW: 
This is a lovely log cabin which offers lots of space for guests to spread out in. 

The kitchen is well appointed with everything you need for a comfortable stay. The mud /ski room makes getting in and out of gear easy albeit it could use a few more spots for skis. The rooms are all a nice size and the tv room is a great space and doesn’t impact the other lounge area (no noise).

The property is about 1km walk from the village which was a nice stroll and not i convenient. The ski in was easy and ended about 50m from the property whilst the walk to put skis on is about 350m slightly uphill. The walk was simple enough.

All in all we really enjoyed the property and found it great value. 

We note previous reviews mentioned the tenant and I would say the current tenant is great! He helped when we got a car stuck after snow fall (driver error - not me) and if you didn’t see his car you wouldn’t have known he was there.

The owner was great really communicated well and when their was an issue with the spa had it fixed quickly.

We traveled with our family of five and friends making a total of 10 guests staying at paradise cove. The home had all the essentials we needed. Everyone slept on the main level since the kids (ages 4-12) felt to far away from the adults when staying in the basement by themselves. With the three queen beds and couch pullout, we all fit just fine. There was a lot if snow fall in the area recently and the owner reached out prior to our arrival advising that 4WD would be recommended for the driveway. We definitely wouldn’t have made it to the home with 2WD. We enjoyed our stay and would love to see the home/area in the summertime.

icy arrival
REVIEW: 
It had snowed during the day before we checked in and the property manager had not snow plowed the steep driveway or the many stairs that lead up to the house. We were not able to drive our suv up the driveway even with chains on. It was dark and slippery and dangerous and not a good welcome. We had to carry all our luggage up the slippery steep driveway then up the icy stairs in order to get into the house. I tried calling the 24/7 phone number listed but it was only a recording. I tried contacting the owner but there was no option to contact them either. Once we got into the house I saw a different 24/7 phone number listed on the paper posted on the wall. Finally after over an hour, I was able to speak to someone with the management company. They sent a guy over to shovel off the driveway and he put cinders and salt down but didn’t clear the stairs. After that we managed to drive one car up but we still were not able to get the suv up the driveway. Later that night we saw two snow plows working on the property next door. We ran out and asked them if they would be so kind a to clear our driveway and stairs snd they did. They said they we’re working for the management company that worked for the properties next to us and they weee preparing for the arrival of their guests. We wondered why our property was not cleared before we arrived. The house itself was very nice and clean and cozy. The balconies were beautiful and it also had a lovely yard for the kids to play in and make snowmen. The instant hot water was a nice touch. They did forget to provide paper towels and dishwasher soap but they brought that over as soon as we asked. It was a great location and we would love to stay there again as long as they cleared the driveway and stairs before arrival.

REVIEW: 
Early October, 2022. 
The listing boasted about the resort having 5 pools but didn’t mention that only one was heated and the others were too cold to use, which meant everyone was in the heated pool, so it was way too crowded with kids (and inconsiderate adults) throwing balls. Pretty tough to enjoy a relaxing day in the pool. Even though the resort was not even close to maximum capacity, the elevators were not capable of handling the traffic flow. It was not uncommon to wait 45 min to an hour for an elevator. They also advertised several restaurants/shops/services on site, many of which were either closed or had very limited hours. To top off our stay, we had vehicle damage while driving toward the parking structure by someone from one of the higher floors throwing a chunk of ice off the balcony. We reported this to the front desk and were told that there was no way to tell which room it came from so they did nothing about it.

TITLE: 
solid choice for the price
REVIEW: 
We stayed here during some very cold, nasty weather. The hosts were 5 star hosts who no one would give a bad review. It makes you feel bad about noting imperfections about your experience with this apartment. 

During cold weather like we experienced, I would give the place a 3 out of 5. Our first night, we were freezing inside. This building observes the laws about maximum heat levels. That means the heat can stay on for a certain number of hours in the morning and evening so there is no heat while you sleep. Also there is a maximum temperature the thermostat should never exceed. It was literally freezing outside and there were definitely drafts. If I knew this before going, I would have booked elsewhere. Hotels and Airbnb's that I have been to prior do not enforce these rules. Anyhow, the next morning, the apartment became warmer when our host allowed the heat to be on continuously when we were home and they provided a space heater for the back bathroom which was the coldest area in the apartment. I only wish they noticed how cold it was and got permission for continuous heat from the beginning. 

Besides this, the apartment had a number other problems which are common for lower cost places. Shower doors which don't slide well, a leaky faucet, poor bathroom ventilation, chipping paint / mold in the bathroom etc. For anyone sleeping on the sofa beds in the front of the apartment, there will be significant night noise. But you don't hear that noise in the 2 bedrooms. 

Bottomline, if you want a GREAT location and a cheap accommodation, this is a fine choice. If you can easily afford better, I would choose somewhere else, especially if it is cold outside. For those considering this apartment in the hot summer, I wouldn't worry as much in early summer. I imagine that the place is a bit like a cave which will remain cool in the heat for quite awhile.

TITLE: 
good location but inside needs improvement
REVIEW: 
We understand the importance of reviews when selecting a place to stay and we want to share our experience with others.

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, note it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children under 6.

Also for the high cost for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests. We have also provided more details to the owners direct to ensure a positive guest experience and with some amends are sure the home will continue to improve in its standards.

TITLE: 
would not recommend!
REVIEW: 
To Whom It May Concern: 
A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.

However, property management company was quick to send someone out to change battery in keyless entry lock, restock all needed supplies and even sent someone out to be sure all items came back up after power outage. Would recommend to others, close to airport and downtown!

REVIEW: 
This is a large home that accommodated my family of eight plus 4 dogs. We all slept well and were comfortable. I expected a lot more for the money we spent though. Bathrooms and kitchen were clean but other areas needed more attention (hair and debris on the night tables etc). There is a large broken armchair that resides in the living room for some reason that is a hazard. Lots of broken blinds. Back door to apartment unit would not open. Hot tub barely accessible (i had to call company to send someone to try and sculpt out a safer access after 3 of us had slipped and fallen). I had to clean up after previous renters dog. Etc... no pride of ownership with this property. Run by a company. Reached out a few days before check in to see if they had a pack and play and high chair, but didnt hear back until day after check in. Was advised that this property did not have those items but in actual fact they do! They were in the large closet located off the living room. This all being said, we enjoyed the area and being able to be all together.

spacious but not luxury
REVIEW: 
Disappointing at best! Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and the Unit had no Wi-Fi !
Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote but NO Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager.

My friends and I rent houses every year and I guess have been lucky with good experiences. This was a very disappointing experience however there was nothing that could be done in the moment so we did not bring these matters up with the host at the time. Again, the house has so much potential with a more work and thought put into it.

last week of january stay
REVIEW: 
The weather was horrible. There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps.

First off the instructions they send you to get in are not correct, they need to update them, we had to call the management to find out how to get into the unit. when we got in the unit it was very clean, but dish in cupboards were dirty, I always wash them first but these were bad. Everything was in working condition.The bed could be replaced, its was lumpy in the middle, like the mattress would bunch up. The couch is very uncomfortable, its a lounger and is hard to get out of, they need to put some lamps and end tables in the living room so you don't have to sit in the dark, yes, there are overhead lights but who wants to sit with those bright lights on. There is no information book for renters on how to use things, hard to figure out the TV with out instructions. Also they could replace the tub with a walk in shower, that is one of the dangerous tubs we have every used and no grab bars in case you lose your balance. The other thing we were disappointed about was that the pool was not heated, guess it has been out since the last hurricane, too bad the host didn't inform us of this, also there was no outdoor seating, as was shown in the pictures. We called about heat and patio seats, but got no real answer, said she would get back to us on it. Never did. This place is in a nice location, close to everything.

Best view ever. The view compensated for the few issues we had. 
Plumbing( one sink plugged and leaking). We had other sinks so we managed. 
The jet tubs ( one did not work) the other we had a issue as well, 
One toilet needed repairs.
Turned off pump for the waterfall, after calling about noise etc. to the manager.
2 of 4 safe boxes not accessible. One lost key and the other a battery needed.
Main kitchen sink faucet plugged ( Edgar came to check it out).
During one yard cleaning there was a problem with a sewer smell.
Pool light out. It was repaired.
We are a clean group, did not opt for cleaning service. But tried to maintain cleanliness during our stay. The 2 mops were were discussting. 
A few tips for future renters:
Slip mats in bath rooms(for older renters (seniors ) or someone with disabilities
Slip free rug at the entrance and exits of the pool. My aunt ( senior) only entered the pool once because of the fear of falls.
A pail and good mop for those who like to sweep and mop during their stay.
Cleaning supplies too. 
A special thanks to Edgar! He was very knowledgeable about where to go . We brought inflatable’s to use for our stay, he got us a pump to blow them all. 
I know Zendis does not own all the homes surrounded the beautiful home we rented. The only thing making it perfect was the loud barks of the old big dogs in the am and the little dog yapping too. 
Loved staying thier great choice!!!!❤️

REVIEW: 
My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Again, my review: 0/10

There are serious safety issues at the property, particularly for seniors. The bath tub should have a mat to prevent slipping. The kitchen cabinets are old and broken. They do not close properly.

TITLE: 
good location but inside needs improvement
REVIEW: 
We understand the importance of reviews when selecting a place to stay and we want to share our experience with others.

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children.

However, for the high cost of $6,000 for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests.

spacious but missing details
REVIEW: 
Overall the location was great, the rooms were spacious, the backyard is nice and the hot tub is large. There are some areas of easy improvement that should be noted: 

Cons:
- Cabinets don't close properly in kitchen
- Not enough towels to do hot tub AND shower (would need 2 per person, only put out 1)
- Only 1 roll of crappy paper towels when every place i've rented provides at least 2
- Hot Tub has some sort of slippery film across the entire thing (inside), causing many of us to slip and bruise easily
- No ziplocks, plastic wrap or foil provided like all other rentals provide (only two medium tupperwares available)
- Bar stools were wobbly, needing to be replaced
- Access to the backyard is ONLY through the main bedroom, no access from main/upper area so we often had to let the dogs go to the bathroom out front instead
- The binder with all the house information was inaccurate - it provided a picture of the thermostat and rules for heating when it was not that thermostat at all. There's 1 heater total for both upstairs and down so drastic temperature change when going up and down
- Bear Box for trash was broken so had to leave trash in garage with previous renter's trash

Pros:
- Location is great: 9 mins to Heavenly California main lodge / also downtown / to lakeside
- Main living areas were spacious, most bedrooms were ok/small with main bedroom massive with fireplace
- Easy check-in
- Can park 2 in garage, 2 in driveway

REVIEW: 
The place itself was good. If you just want to crash, it s great...If you are looking for a quiet place to hang, this is not it. You WILL hear everything that is going on upstairs, from walking to anything else... When we stayed there was a toddlers upstairs who started running around 5am... woke us up. Then someone with a dog that wouldn't stop barking checked in next door... no fun.

There was a moldy smell when we moved in (like grandma's closet), and the curtain rod in the shower was loose (and fell on my head). Called Vacasa and they handled the rod, but said the smell was ""curry"". Also, talked to Vacasa and Vrbo about partial refund and they gave me a long runaround, no call backs, etc. 

I wont stay in a vacasa managed property again.

REVIEW: 
The view can't be beat. The house itself is comfortable but a little tired and in need of some TLC. The living room is comfy and the kitchen is well equipped. The deck is amazing (that view!). The beach is lovely and we found some amazing treasures while beachcombing. There is no light in the 2nd bedroom (queen bed). We took a lamp from the living room and used it. The shower is very slippery and the addition of an inexpensive rubber shower mat would greatly improve safety. In the room with the king bed the dresser drawers were all full of extra linens so there was no place to put our clothes. The blinds on the living room windows are missing some handles and cords and some of the windows need cleaning. Just a little TLC is all that is needed.

floramar terrace
REVIEW: 
Pluses: Clean property and safe location. Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers. No salt & pepper, cooking oil, cooking oil spray, no recycling bin, no waste baskets In laundry room and bedrooms, slippery tub with no tub mat, only seating in living room area is an uncomfortable couch. Property is listed as sleeping 6 but only seating for 4 inside. Too small for 6. Instead of spending $$ on a sofa bed and an inflatable bed on lanai & a karaoke machine, they should provide more basics.

The view is nice, location is close to the shuttle and simple to get to town. The snowboard/ski/shoe removal/storage area on the ground floor is a positive. The garage was big enough for my full size pickup. The furniture in the sitting area is not comfortable. Couch needs new cushions. TV has blown speakers. The fireplace has an annoying thumping sound when it gets going. The master BR does not have any place to put luggage on...used a chair from dining table. The master bed is fairly hard. The master bath floor is extremely slippery when wet!!! Overall, good place to stay, but needs attention to upgrades for the price.

spacious but not luxury
REVIEW: 
Disappointing at best! Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager.

just as advertised!
REVIEW: 
Property is exactly as advertised! Beautiful view of lagoon, and Large Iguana sunning in tree just outside the patio enclosure!

The Good: Lots of room to spread out; gorgeous upstairs bathroom/tub/ shower; beds were SUPER comfy; washer dryer newer and worked great: came stocked with lots of spices and starter coffee and filters (may have been left by previous occupants); third floor patio furniture nicely padded; private. VERY CLEAN! 

Property Highlights: The clean pool, the jetty you could walk out to see sunrise/ sunsets, plenty of outdoor seating in and out of the sun. Lagoon is full of beautiful fish and lobster. Bought a snorkel mask at Walgreens (a short bike ride away). Clean, friendly Security at Gatehouse and Grounds Staff do a great job keeping things garbage free and tidy.

The “However…”s BIG THiNG: (Condo itself) the ground floor level has a step up to the landing and bedroom, then you turn to go up to the main level. Coming back DOWN, turn on the landing, open door into downstairs living room and there’s a STEP DOWN that I missed twice, and my mother actually fell. It’s just a regular step down in the same color tile that needs a sign, or yellow/red tape on the ground level. I had a laundry basket in my hand so stumbled down into the room and caught myself. My mom fell down and caught herself on the pullout couch bar and we spent the day at the hospital. EASY FIX, I am writing to the owners. I just don’t want someone else’s vacation to be spent at Mariner’s (GREAT little hospital and EMS and ER staff!) I pray you don’t need it. It was 100% avoidable.

The stairs are steep and narrow. Anyone with knee/ ambulatory issues ((or big feet!) should just put up the money and go stay at the Mariner’s Club as their condos are one-floor living (and gorgeous-my sister stayed there). 

The third floor patio was missing a screened panel, but I am assuming it’s from a recent storm and on the To Do list as the gnats came out in the evening, and there was a paper wasp nest above it so anyone with a bee allergy would have been concerned. 

Tiny things: Two shower doors didn’t have plastic/rubber dams so water came out under the door which is no big deal EXCEPT when someone is more susceptible to a slipping hazard.

Property (not condo itself) The walkway lamp light was out so it made traversing the outdoor stairs from main floor patio to lagoon walkway difficult (we used cell phone light but I was still not the safest)

REVIEW: 
The Good: For our trip, this house functioned as we needed. We were attending a conference in downtown Atlanta & this was within a 10 min drive & was large enough for our group. You can tell they have put work into the property & it's not a bad place today. We even talked about possibly staying there again.

The Bad: 3 leaks in the ceiling, under furniture was gross, inside door closing issues, wet/slippery bathroom floors, dryer was SUPER squeaky, water seeping in under exterior back door, etc.

The UGLY: 3 of our people arrived early, 2 of them being police officers. When they arrived 1 of them sat on a wicker chair, and it collapsed. Then during the evening someone simply sat on another wicker chair, and it collopased. There was no horseplay or anything rough with them. They simply sat down and the broke & the corn hole board I leaned up against a wall & a leg broke. I tried to contact the owner to try & tell him some of the issues we had & explain the chair to try and help him as we were some of his first renters but he was not wiling to talk to me on the phone-& the list was long enough I was not going to sit there and text him. He then proceeded to charge me over 500$ in damages. I tried to speak w/ him but he wasn't willing to communicate.

If they can fix the leaks & have actual beds(not air mattresses) for people this is a great place. But be aware, they will charge you for anything and not speak to you about your stay.

My husband and I just wanted to get out of the house for a weekend, and this was a fun little trip for us!
 The keyless entry is really a brilliant idea! The apartment is just as described in the ad. We are walkers and had no trouble walking to H Street where we found restaurants, Whole Foods Market, plus free transport to Union Station. We did use Uber for the first time and loved it - DC is super-tricky to drive around (for us), so it was a great choice.
The bed was a semi-firm memory foam mattress, very comfortable and the shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower floor was a little slippery so I put down a kitchen towel for safety - it was great, otherwise! There was plenty of streaming channels on tv, and we had no trouble with the WIFI. We highly recommend this apartment and would stay here again!

REVIEW: 
Mattresses were all hard as a rock. My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

TITLE: 
worst stay ever in hawaii
REVIEW: 
A very dangerous sunk tub in master bathroom. I fell in and was hurt and it ruined my entire trip. Railing or complete removal of this tub should be done. I have brusied left leg, sprain right ankle and bruised right ribs. we arrived at the home all the lock box codes were wrong the housekeeper forgot to put in new codes for us. we get a call from the owner that the day we were to leave was 1/23 and that we were still in the house on on 1/24 according to the housekeeper. We left the house at 9:00 am on 1/23 to our other rental in Kona. 10 days later the owner called and said that we stained the carpet. The carpet had stains from all over the carpet on our arrival on 1/17. I have been to the big island +10 times and this is the worst home we have rented it destroyed my vacation. That bathroom sunken tile tub is dangerous even if its lighted or dark. This could be very good rental if the owners would correct some safety issues, a fall into this tub could kill someone if they hit their head. I was hurt but I also was very lucky it could of been alot worst

disappointing!
REVIEW: 
· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

REVIEW: 
The location of this property was great. Right on the beach with a heated pool down below. Close to good restaurants and shopping. But the unit itself was sadly lacking in care. Doors hanging on hinges, bathroom fixtures falling off, furniture scratched, dirty and kind of cheap, broken window blinds, hard beds, suspicious stains on one of the only 2 beach chairs. And it needed a thorough deep clean. I had booked the place for myself and four friends and was somewhat embarrassed. I will definitely not go back. There are other rentals in the same building that looked kind of nice if you can figure out which they are.

This was our family’s second trip to this home and we have booked for next year. 
It is simply the best rental when entertaining little ones to seniors. 
The kitchen had everything we needed to cook most meals, the lanai and pool area offered hours of fun and the location near beautiful beaches is a great plus. 
Yes, the home needs a little spiffing up, carpets are pretty dirty, some window screens broken; however, our family can easily overlook those little details and focus on all the great amenities of this home. 
Thank you for sharing your home.

REVIEW: 
The fireplace didn’t work. The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around, the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs earlier if it was allowed. They said yes, one hour no problem and 2 hours yes for $50 each of those hours. Since it actually came to about $5,300.00 for the 3 nights (2 days) another 100 bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on the check out .procedure.

What we disliked: the unit we stayed in was not the one listed. I even asked the property manager about this prior to our stay because I noted they own multiple units in the building and previous reviewers called attention to this. They assured me it was going to be the one listed and it was not. We were happy with our unit, regardless. One of the key FOBs was very finicky (low battery perhaps?) and we were stuck in the parking garage upon check out for 20 minutes until another vehicle come through and let us out with their FOB. The owner was responsive in a timely manner but seemed put out by this requiring their attention and somewhat dismissive at the suggestion the FOB needed attention. If you have a small child, please be aware that the windows in the bedroom do not have safety locks. The unit was on the 5th floor and have awning windows with a small opening large enough for a small child to fit though.

TITLE: 
rental is very misleading and very poorly kept/managed
REVIEW: 
Summary: Overall a very poor experience. Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!

Upon glass on the floor broken. arrival, a large window in the main living space was broken- really broken - like glass on the floor still broken. It was obvious someone had been out to slap a piece of plywood on it but there was a considerable draft , glass on the floor and in the crevices of the fireplace and NO dustpan to be found for clean up. It was snowing and about 18 degrees. I immediately started calling the management company but after remaining on hold for 20 minutes which was enough time to hear the timbertop jingle enough times to memorize it! I went and bought a dust pan at the local store , placed some plastic wrap over the window and shoved a chair against it to help with the draft since we had babies and small children arriving. . I tried to contact the property manager by email and was unable to contact anyone that way either. One of the King size beds was actually a double. The refrigerator looked like someone tool a shot gun to it, The lampshade in the living room was shredded. The 4 ammenities -hot tub,- (smelled funky) pool(slimy bottom), pool table (no tips on sticks- no chalk) and theater room(would not connect to surround sound) all had issues. We were missing an entire shower curtain in one of the bathrooms, the dryer didn't dry(heating element?) and a towel rack promptly fell off the wall when a towel was applied. I was able to contact the company the second night of our stay and they sent someone out the 3rd night. We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic. After hearing the issues they offered less than 10% discount for our trouble. This was not the luxury cabin experience our family Christmas celebration was expecting .

some issues
REVIEW: 
While Arabian Nights was conveniently located for us, the experience was one we’d like to not repeat. We were excited to check in and enjoy the hot tub and pool right away as we had been traveling all day and my family was looking forward to relaxing. Unfortunately when we arrived at 5 PM, the pool crew was waiting to repair a broken heater, it wasn’t ready for a few more hours and it was still cold. There are no instructions on how to control the hot tub/pool heat so I called Vacay Stay to get a tutorial and was informed that there are restrictions on the temperature settings unless we wanted to pay extra (they did offer a late checkout for the inconvenience though). Considering it was in the 40s and 50s while we were there, the swimming pool was too cold at 78° to utilize. In addition to the pool/hot tub issues the top rack of the dishwasher didn’t work so after another call a crew was sent to remove it, not fix or replace it. As a family of five, we ran out of dishes each day because we couldn’t wash them all in the now half capacity dishwasher. On top of that, there were only five forks in the entire house, which made for another headache, having to hand wash dishes after every meal (certainly a favorite vacation activity). We called Vacay Stay again and they did bring additional forks. 

There’s no local television programming available at the home so unless you have your own streaming services don’t expect to watch any tv. After a long exhausting day we were ready to call it a night, and what a long uncomfortable night it was!! The master bedroom has a king size bed with little to no support in the middle and we found ourselves rolling into a king sized hole all night long! This made for a miserable night sleep with stiff backs the next day (which fyi, a cold hot tub doesn’t really help). We again called Vacay Stay who told us that there is nothing wrong with the bed, it’s just a soft mattress. 

Aside from all of the minor issues and headaches above, the lovely touch of kitchen utensils and broken broom handles wedged into the windows for security because the locks are broken was special. The neighbors dog that didn’t stop barking for four days straight was just the added touch every guest is looking for! 

Oh, did I mention the freight train washing machine? Make sure to do the laundry while you’re out and about, it has a slight rumble that could easily be mistaken for San Andreas fault activity.

The property is nothing special. It is as advertised but could use a lot of updating. The temperature was difficult to control. The basement would get warm but the second and third floors were always a bit cold with the heat cranked all the way up. Matt was very helpful and the property is right up the hill from the ski resort. The slope was not fully open and the run that had the ski on/off accessibility was closed. That was not communicated to us beforehand so make sure to double check if you are wanting that option. The public pool is a bit of a walk, my wife actually drove down when she brought our children to swim. Also no one under 15 is allowed in the hot tub. There were no major problems with the service just a lot of little things with the property (broken chair, broken cabinet door, stained carpet, upstairs draft where the window unit sits, etc.) I would say it was not the greatest but certainly not the worst place we have ever stayed.

disappointing - items not working and not as advertised
REVIEW: 
A friend and I stayed at this property for five days for MLK weekend in Jan 2023. We had some sun, some rain and cooler temps. We looked forward to sitting outside in the back and inside to talk and write. We were visiting another friend in our Writers' Group. We were disappointed the owners haven't kept the property up to date and many things are deteriorating. We were disappointed with Vacasa, as property managers for not doing simple repairs like attaching door knobs and keeping lights working. There were post-its noting what wasn't working! We sent this list to Vacasa of the problems:
1) The main bathroom and bedroom (by pool) smell like rotten sewage and mold. We are allergic to mold and had allergies during our stay. Those rooms are only useable when the windows are open, which is cold and a safety hazard since they are at ground level. 
2) Driveway gate entry keypad doesn’t work. Vacasa knew, but gave us a code at in person check-in and let us try. When I called Vacasa back I learned it didn't work (?!)
2B) Driveway gate entry key fob in house only will open or close once. If we wanted to open, leave the driveway, and then close the gate, the gate would not close. Gate box does not respond to the key fob on any second request.
3) Issues around the house were simply noted on post-it notes around the house, as if that made the issues ok. 
4) The only outside door that works to the backyard (two others were locked down) had this post-it: “Door handle falls off.” Once in back, it’s difficult to get back in because the handle falls off (it only needs a set screw).
5) Important inside lights do not work. Some are noted on a post-it. The main kitchen light is out. So is laundry room/back hall light, which is the only light at night to the second bathroom. The exterior driveway/breezeway light, visible from the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom, is motion detect and strobes when on, which is distracting. 
6) The listing leads one to believe that guests will have two bedrooms with two fully working bathrooms, ""perfect for two couples.” However, one bathroom is across the house. The main bathroom’s “soaker tub” is a one-person wall tub with a note on it “tub is not operational”; its plumbing and tap are closed-off.
7) The bath's retro ""features"" are rotting and deteriorating. 

Overall, the house is not as advertised. Location is good, backyard and pool are nice, but can not carry this amount of issues. Repairs and updates are needed.

beautiful cabin with a picturesque view on the mountains
REVIEW: 
If you are looking for a quiet, cozy, relaxing place to go, this is where you want to be. Nestled up in the woods, well of the main roads, you'll find this little cabin. 
Inside, everything, i mean everything you need except food. The living room has a great view of the mountains in front of the cabin. Kitchen is well stocked with all utensils, dishes, pans etc that you could need. A spacious bathroom with laundry. And a king size bed, one of the most comfortable beds we've slept on. We are actually looking to replace ours with the one there it was so comfortable.
Outside is setup nice for warmer days. A sitting deck, patio with table and chairs, ambient lighting and a firepit all with a serene backdrop of the white mountains. When we arrived there was already 4-6 inches of snow and as we left another 6-10 more coming down, but we pulled up our chairs and watched the snow fall out the window.
The owner is fantastic. Very accommodating and communicates everything clear and simple. 
This is by far one of our best rental choices.

Don’t rent this place. House was not as pictured. Shades on windows we broken and did not lock. Sheets and comforters were dirty (went out and bought our own). Basement had about and inch of water and that’s where the washer and driver were located. Plumping made a weird sound that could be heard throughout the house. Furniture was rundown and broken. Neighborhood was rundown and was not in walking distance to the “town”. This place ruined what was supposed to be a celebration weekend and VRBO did nothing to help us. Will never rent from them again!

REVIEW: 
The fireplace didn’t work. The windows had large orange stickers on them saying that there were broken windows that needed replacing. Couldn’t open curtains to enjoy viewing the snow because there were large orange stickers in the center of them. Upon initial walk through, after 15 hour drive we noticed the first cups we grabbed to make a tea had spaghetti sauce on the rims. A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs. The house rental was so that our dogs could experience snowy walks for our probably only road trip to the mountains and snow. I wanted to let itripsteamboat know about the initial findings. They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs hotel earlier if it was allowed. They said one hour early- no problem and 2 hours yes for an hourly fee.. Since it actually came to over five racks for the 3 nights (2 days) another few bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on how to check out. Argumentative

TITLE: 
everything was 80% correct
REVIEW: 
Here is my overly thorough take on this 4/5 star cabin
 
Cons:

Can confirm there are many minor issues in every room. 

Stained comforter, mildew in shower door, broken toilet paper holder, double wall windows had inner windows shut but some outer windows open. 

Fireplaces did not work.
 
Kitchen was barely supplied, no salt or pepper, gross sponges and soap container, only a few pots and pans and only 2 sheet pans total.

I know it sounds dumb but the light switches were confusing. There would be a panel with 3 switches where one is power to the switch the middle one is also power but with a dimmer and the third one was a mystery switch that did nothing. 

Dvd player seems to function until you put a dvd in. Myself and 2 others all have 4 year degrees in computer related fields and none of us could figure out the AV situation in any room. 

Outdoor space was winterized (duh) and this is onky a con because it obviously hadnt been looked after for a year or so because there was dirt build up on everything. 

The gas grill downstairs was a joke. I dont think you could fit more than 2 burgers on it and the gas wouldnt ignite even. 

Downstairs kitchen had 1 plate and a dirty knife in a drawer otherwise empty. 


It is out in the country so if you arent used to country darkness it may seem very dark. That being said the drive out there is incredibly hilly and winding with multiple blind hills where you cannot see over them until you are over during day and nighttime. And the drive into galena is 30 minutes away 



Pros: 

Decently secluded and thick walls give great privacy. 

Water pressure was awesome. 

Hot tub was clean and hot when we arrived but the floor was soaked from previous rainstorm. Also only door to hot tub from inside is through the master bedroom. (Sorry not a pro, I know) 

Lots of cups bowls and plates

Plenty of parking room 

Great view of nature from all windows

Plenty of fridge and freezer space 

Comfy couches

Lots of games 

Held heat very well and distributed heat well 

Plenty of towels/wash cloths




All in all like i said 80% correct, place honestly just needs some small fixes everywhere and it would be perfect.

REVIEW: 
Too good to be true.... 

This property was advertised as a two bedroom. It is NOT. It is a studio apartment with a bed and a futon in the kitchen. 
Upon arrival my family and I came to a parking area and this stay is located in the back building behind a car park, a bit sketchy and uneasy feeling. Upon entry, the hallway leading to the apartment was wide open, and mailboxes were broken and smashed in. We get to our door and the lock box barely worked. Entering, everything looked ok, further settling in and checking out the space, the window was left open, dust everywhere, broken cabinets, entry way door frame broken scratched as though someone had attempted breaking in. Cooking glass countertop chipped and broken. Food residue on plates. Pillow cases with black stains and dirt marks. We pulled the bed sheets back and saw more black/dirt marks, fresh spots of blood and pubic hair. 
The bathroom photographed in these photos is not the layout of the actual bathroom we had. 
The faucet for said bathroom was also broken. Upon booking in Oct when I wrote to the host, he never got back to me. Upon arrival, it took VRBO and myself several attempts to reach the owner and they did not respond to any of my messages until after the remainder of payment was made. 
After contacting VRBO, and by THEIR suggestion to contact the owner/manager of said property to give them the opportunity to rectify the situation. 
To may dismay their attempt to rectify the situation by giving them a day to ""change the sheets""...... the one with blood and pubic hair on them....

We decided not to stay because of the unsanitary practices of listing and misrepresentation of the listing, and because as a guest I believe that their resolution was unsatisfactory. 
We were advised by VRBO that we could not cancel since we arrived at the location and it was up to the owner to decide whether or not they wanted to refund our money.... you can see where this is going. Even though I wanted to cancel the reservation the DAY OF arrival. 
6-8 phone calls/chats later and ""we're sorry you've experienced this"" with VRBO for the promise of sending my inquiry to management... nothing, no response, no follow up and 8 case file numbers later. 
Not only do I suggest NOT to book with City Sparrow Apartments, I would reconsider booking with Vrbo.

house needs a lot of tlc
REVIEW: 
Amazing views from roof, lovely area, great parking. The house is neglected inside and out. Furniture was swollen and smelled of damp. Missing light fittings, cracking electrical switches. Master bedroom side light and ceiling light never worked, only the far side light worked. Vacuum cleaner but no bag, we had to go buy them in the end. Outside furniture was dangerous and my husband was lucky not to be impaled when a plastic chair literally exploded into shards beneath him. Cushion pads were eventually replaced, as the ones supplied were shredded, faded and covered in mould. Many things broken, worn out, damaged by dampness, leaking, electrics need attention, needs a new door lock, windows and doors all leak in the rain, beds are like camp beds, look terrible, however, credit where it’s due, they were surprisingly comfortable. The bedding is ancient and poor quality, bleach marks, worn out elastic. Things that were listed on the inventory weren’t there. Enormous amount of Crockery and cutlery, mismatched glasses, two coffee machines, needs severely edited, it sleeps 3 comfortably. No need for several settings and stacks of chopping boards. Kitchen units are old and bursting at floor level, fridge was absolutely tiny and shelves fell off the door, all have hairline cracks. The owner did replace the washing machine, which was temperamental. Bathroom sliding door kept falling off the mounting. Both of us jammed our hands in the patio doors, as there’s no safety stop. Inside the house was like a fridge in winter, we had to clean mould several times and our clothes were wet in the unlined wardrobes. We bought many humidifiers. No aircon means the walls are like powder and the house manager was unable to replace the curtain pole or fix the shower properly to the wall. We lived with the curtains held up by tape for many weeks. This could be a lovely house, but it needs work. The patio area gets no winter sun, but the roof does, the furniture on the roof however needs replaced, it’s not just ugly, it’s dangerous. If it’s important, the TV only had Spanish Channels. We used our own steaming stick, which worked, but the sound quality on the TV is tinny at anything above quite. The house was clean on arrival, but inside the cupboards were grimy and some crockery sticky with grease, which j didn’t use, as there’s just far too much crockery and unnecessary stuff in a rental. I binned the toilet brush, after it was knocked over and I won’t go into detail, but I binned it and left a brand new one for the owner, it was disgusting. We needed to buy a basin, as the sink didn’t hold water. The additional blanket provided was dirty and too bulky to wash in the machine in the house, I thankfully had taken our own throws. No towels provided by the owner. If we didn’t have a dog with us, there’s no way we would have stayed in the house, not in the condition it’s in. The owner seems like a nice man, but really didn’t want to be bothered with me and I found myself resolving or dealing with things myself.

disappointing! bugs, mould, run down!
REVIEW: 
We stayed at this property for a week in Dec of 2022. The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.

Leaky windows, useless heater system, broken slider in primary room was too cold to sleep in. Dirty condo but linens were surprisingly clean. There was tic tacs or pills left on the carpet in the primary. Opened toothpaste and other products left in bathroom and refrigerator. Tubs and sink were gross and need to be replaced. I don’t recommend this place. I’ve stayed at many mountain back condos, this was the worst.

nice place but awful check-in process
REVIEW: 
The pros - the place was nice / cute / cozy, very clean, spacious for 2 people, great location and great amenities.

The cons about the unit - fireplace doesn't work (we called and asked them to fix it and they said we
needed a key which we didn't have), the window shade in the bedroom is broken (stuck down - better
than being stuck up!), the bed/pillows are not very comfortable, and the furniture is dated.

The awful check-in process – we arrived at 415pm to check in and could not get the lock box to open with the code provided. We called the 1-800 number and they couldn’t verify the code to use and said they would send someone to help us ASAP (no time committed). We checked through the emails and texts again and found another code for the lockbox, we tried, and it worked to open the lockbox EXCEPT
the lockbox was empty – no keys! We called the 1-800 number again, no answer after 20 minutes. We
called the 1-800 number again and got connected with someone, we explained the situation and got disconnected mid-way through the call with no call back. We called a 4th time and got connected with someone who said this was the first document of the complaint. They said they would send someone ASAP but no time was committed. Finally, 2 hours and 45 minutes after our initial attempt we got into the building.

In addition to the issues getting into the building we also were not able to find the parking pass in the unit that was required to park in the garage (normally this is placed in plain sight with other key items). We called the 1-800 number and were told to look on the kitchen counter (obvious) and inside the ski
locker (not sure why it would be there but it wasn’t). It was 10pm when we called and they said there was nothing they could do about it at that time but they would come ASAP. They never followed up.

We really enjoyed our stay at the Timberline Retreat. The house is pretty much brand new with all new modern appliances and everything you need to relax and enjoy your vacation. The beds and pillows are comfortable, we all slept great. Much needed after some long fun ski days at the pass. 

No cell service so make sure you screenshot your welcome message from Lane that has the door entry code. Wifi is great and we had about 15 devices connected without issue. You can make calls etc. from the Wi-Fi.

One window shade was broken and we couldn’t use the fireplace as it was being worked on. This was communicated to us prior to arrival so we knew what to expect. 

Great communication from the owner as well! 

All in all a wonderful experience and we will be returning again soon!

REVIEW: 
Overall the property was decent. Check in was simple. The condo was spacious. The views are nice. Unfortunately they have closed the skiing down on this side of the resort. So there is NO Ski-in/Ski-out access.

There was an awful lot of previous water damage, and it appears that nothing has been maintained or updated, ever.

The upstairs bedroom is lacking a window and is unsafe for children. The railing at the top of the stairs overlooking the loft has a broken plastic netting to help keep children from climbing through the spindles and over the edge. This needs to be replaced.

The condo was sufficient for our stay, but pretty disappointed about the overall accommodations. The floors were dirty, and we mopped everything. There were obvious spills (soda/juice) in the kitchen that were present when we arrived. The television in the main bedroom does not work.

In its original shape I am sure this was a fantastic place. It could be very nice again with a few updates.

O caseiro que deveria cuidar da limpeza externa e piscina, mal o víamos durante nossa estada. A casa necessita de uma reforma ampla, as camas são box, porém só tem uma espuma que vem na cama, ou seja, não tem colchão, as noites foram muito mal dormidas. Nas suítes inferiores não tem janela de ventilação, em uma determinada noite caiu um pedaço do forro de gesso, quase atingiu uma criança que dormia. No anuncio consta como 7 suítes e na verdade são 6 suítes e um closed que foi considerado como quarto. Pegamos dois dias de chuva, ai apareceram várias infiltrações pela casa, quando utilizávamos a churrasqueira era goteira pra tudo que é lado. No anuncio constava que água, energia e internet faz parte do aluguel, porém o proprietário queria nos cobrar R$300,00 por um caminhão pipa de água potável, isso gerou um stress devido as várias mensagens que recebi nos cobrando essa conta. Por fim, após uma ampla reforma a casa Boedo se tornará atrativa, mas antes que isso aconteça não recomendo.

TITLE: 
property needs some attention
REVIEW: 
This is the second time staying at this property. In the year since I was last here, the property (unfortunately) has clearly not been maintained. 

- The home has a lot of wear and tear, and has a dingy feel to it. Lots of dings in the walls and doors, worn/stained carpet, loose bannisters, broken window shades, etc. I question if the sheets in my bed were changed, based on all the hair when I pulled back the covers the first night.
- The plumbing was an issue during our stay, with a leaky pipe in one bathroom, and a broken handle in the other. To be fair, the local property manager Keith was on it in a hurry.
- The hot tub was a nice add, but the water was terribly filmy. It takes more than a chlorine floaty to keep those things clean.
- The kitchen still does not have enough utensils for cooking, and only glassware to drink out of- not good if you have kids! 
- The check-in/out process is very easy, as Vacasa provides a lot of information.
- As stated above, the local property management is very responsive. This was the case last year as well, which was a pleasant surprise this time around.
- Lastly, this would be a really nice place to stay with just a little more TLC. The home has all the potential to be a solid vacation rental- it has great amenities, its in a decent location, and its fairly close to stores, restaurants, and the ski resort.

REVIEW: 
We had a party of 10 the fact that it had 5 bedrooms and all bedrooms had there own bath was awesome. 
The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people.

REVIEW: 
Four of us stayed in the 2 bedroom location. It was initially hard to find since the there were no distinguishing signs for the turn off to the location. After calling the caretaker, she was able to talk us through the directions to the property. The place was comfortable, but could use a bit of maintenance. It wouldn’t take much to make this place a 9 out of 10. As it stands it’s probably a 6/7 out of 10. Fresh paint to cover water stain in the ceiling, replace broken bathroom exhaust fan cover, replace torn porch window screen. All of those cosmetic issues give the place a shabby look. On the positive side, the place has all you need for a short stay. Nice kitchen with full size refrigerator and utensils for cooking. Adequate seating in the living room. Tv with cable service and fast wifi. Bed were comfortable. The 1 bathroom was adequate in size, just a bit dated/worn down, but clean. It’s a short drive to Key West so it serves at a nice jumping off point. Did not get to use any of the other amenities such as the pool since we were there in January. Good value for the price and condition of the property. Would stay there again. Beware of hidden fees. His was my first Vrbo rental so that maybe typical for the service.

REVIEW: 
We booked mostly for the air hockey table, which didn’t blow enough air to work properly so that was disappointing. Carpet had been vacuumed and sinks and toilets were clean but the place badly needs a deep clean. Walls and baseboards and window ledges were filthy. The mini blinds in the “kids” room (bunk bed room) were all broken so the kids were up with the sun. The floors are entirely splitting and coming up in several areas, a real trip hazard for a toddler or elderly. The furniture was equally beat up, the chair in the living room looked like it was rescued from a curb. There was no toilet paper in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen. Sponges were scary dirty, thankfully we brought our own of all of these things…washed every dish before we used it, especially the utensils, because the drawers were so gross inside. The lights over the dining room table didn’t work and the remote control lights for the other rooms were wonky, my daughter was trying to turn hers on and it turned mine off. As for the pros: good location, we felt safe, good size yard to play in and plenty of space for a family or two. We enjoyed the sleds they provided. I really liked the cubbies in the kitchen and all the rooms. Check in was easy and host was communicative. The place has potential but really needs some attention. I understand new flooring is expensive but at minimum the place needs a deep cleaning and new blinds in the one room, and that would cost less than we paid for our stay so I just don’t understand why it’s not been done.

REVIEW: 
This cabin is in an excellent location close to the skyline caverns/drive. The kitchen is well stocked with every utensil you could possibly need and the bathrooms are modern. TVs in all bedrooms and other living areas. Games and puzzles for the kids downstairs were a bonus. 

We stayed as a family with 4 children aged 5-11. The house is jam packed with hunting stuff and sharp woodworking tools which may be hazardous for inquisitive children. Although there is a wood burning stove in the living room this was not available to guests due to insurance. This was disappointing as we were hoping to do s’mores with the kids. That said there is a fire pit (of sorts) in the back yard. 

The outside area requires a lot of work and is obviously undergoing landscaping. Unfortunately, tools required for this were scattered around the yard and this could be dangerous for kids. However, there was plenty of other space for them to run around and once the yard is finished it will be great.

disappointing! bugs, mould, run down!
REVIEW: 
We stayed at this property for a week in Dec of 2022. The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.

travelers beware - do not stay here!
REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use Airbnb all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

disappointing!
REVIEW: 
· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

REVIEW: 
AVOID, on the first day we couldn’t even check in on time as the owner was still there looking for her keys. We were empathetic towards this so helped where we could. Once we had finally all settled in, she knocked and came through the house two or three times looking for them and we had to move our cars several times as they went in and out. She then left her phone in the house and all throughout the evening until 11:30pm it rang on and off waking us and our children several times until we could finally locate it and discovered whose phone it was! Our first day felt like an absolute shambles because of all this and we didn’t get to properly relax at all. We then had crappy intermittently working internet the whole trip despite us saying we relied on the internet overnight (medical reason) Cheryl’s communication around this was rubbish until the final morning when she decided to call spark and by then it was too late. And no, DVDs on offer did not fix the issue we had overnight. The kayaks are decrepit and not safe for young kids to be on so don’t bother there. And to top off our holiday, despite us being SO patient and kind towards Cheryl the entire trip, she then accuses us off breaking a wheel on a trundler we didn’t even use and is charging us an extra $845 because of this and due to sand in the house and some fingerprints on the sliding door and the couch.. We were at a BEACH house with 4 young kids - come on! I grew up with a parent who was a cleaner, that parent was staying with us. We left that house cleaner than most would have, even wiping out her fridge and only left the vacuuming and linen washing for the cleaner. There are NO instructions that say any trace of sand is banned in the beach house, I rinsed off all their togs in the sink next to the washing machine, as anyone would but I’m not the perfect mum. It’s impossible for some sand not to escape me, I did my best but to charge us over $800 for sand and fingerprints is UNREASONABLE. I saw her previous review where she accused other guests of water damage and nearly didn’t book because of it but figured it was isolated and surely we’d be all good but it seems like this is just the way the owner is, she was so angry about the fact she was out of pocket for losing her keys and so she’s now clutching at straws trying to recoup some of that loss by charging us for ridiculous things. We will not be paying for this and are just grateful to have a lawyer in our family to sort her out.

Although this property is within easy access to the beach and the river we found the bedrooms lacked storage space, the outdoor furniture was very difficult to manage as it is heavy, unstable and hard to move. Being able to spend as much time as possible outside is important for a family. We used the bar b que and found only 2 burners worked.

With a small child, this is not safe
TITLE: 
not a good fit
REVIEW: 
After much thought, my husband and I would give this a 3 out of 5. It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child.

REVIEW: 
The property itself was nice (had been updated, was clean, etc.), but it was not located in a nice area of town. We were expecting the area to be up and coming based on the information in the posting, but it was still in what seemed to be a pretty rough area (we observed multiple police cars and ambulance stop in the neighborhood throughout the weekend and watched a neighbor get arrested as we first checked in). The only issue with the house itself was there was no wine opener (which was an easy fix!) and the toilet became clogged. Everything else was as advertised in the posting and the host was very responsive/ easy to work with. 

Perhaps if it’s all adults staying at the property then the location might not matter as much, but we didn’t feel particularly safe at this property (particularly because we were traveling with children).

breathtaking views, gorgeous cabin
REVIEW: 
Our family thoroughly enjoyed our long weekend at Foothills Lodge. The views were spectacular! The cabin is secluded, but yet close enough to town to enjoy all the sights, shopping and activities. The cabin is welcoming and has plenty of room for families to enjoy and not feel crowded. We were also thrilled to find such an incredible cabin that welcomed our little pup as well! 
One bit of advice to those with smaller children, the steps leading down to the bottom (game room) floor are very steep. Make sure to be careful and assist any younger children going up and down. We had no issues (my youngest is 16 yrs old), but little ones may need an extra hand just to be on the safe side 😊 

The beds are very comfortable and the back deck was my favorite spot to relax (minus the cold weather LOL). We have already recommended it to some of our family and friends and plan to return again ourselves in the future. The hosts were extremely friendly, responsive and made check in and check out very easy! Thank you again for sharing your slice of Heaven with our family! 
PS- The cleaning crew does a fantastic job! We’ve stayed in many cabins over the years and this one was by far the cleanest and most well kept. Can’t wait to come back!

REVIEW: 
Overall the property was decent. Check in was simple. The condo was spacious. The views are nice. Unfortunately they have closed the skiing down on this side of the resort. So there is NO Ski-in/Ski-out access.

There was an awful lot of previous water damage, and it appears that nothing has been maintained or updated, ever.

The upstairs bedroom is lacking a window and is unsafe for children. The railing at the top of the stairs overlooking the loft has a broken plastic netting to help keep children from climbing through the spindles and over the edge. This needs to be replaced.

The condo was sufficient for our stay, but pretty disappointed about the overall accommodations. The floors were dirty, and we mopped everything. There were obvious spills (soda/juice) in the kitchen that were present when we arrived. The television in the main bedroom does not work.

In its original shape I am sure this was a fantastic place. It could be very nice again with a few updates.

nice view and bedding - poor water/power/wi-fi and rocky beach
REVIEW: 
Some pros and cons:

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean

We stayed at the red corvette house from Jan 12-21st, 2023. The location of this house was great for Disney and Universal. The pool heat was mediocre but it was Jan and pretty cold. The Spa heat worked very well as did the hot water inside the home. We were a party of 5 adults and the house was just big enough for us, the addition of the converted garage into a theater room really added to the space and we hung out in that room quite a bit. We made popcorn almost every day after we gave the machine a much needed cleaning. The house would be so nice with a thorough cleaning from top to bottom, new bedding, new towels, new pots and pans, replace the broken screen in the pool lanai area and replace the old dishwasher. My son-in-law fixed the dishwasher but it is truly on it's last leg. You're welcome! We would not stay here again because of the poor maintenance/cleanliness of this home. It is a shame, I wish I could give it a better review but I can't.

We loved our time here. The pictures don't do it justice. The house is even nicer in person than it appears. The island is easy to get to (assuming you have a boat). The views were unbelievable. We had drinks by the platform watching sunset every night. Our young kids could run around and play without any concerns for their safety. The cove is very protected and was a lot of fun to relax and swim off of the dock. The house was well supplied. And the hosts were fantastic. Day or night, they were available and gave us a ton of suggestions on places to visit and things to do. We had a vacation that helped us create memories that we will cherish for a lifetime. We'll definitely be back again. The only heads up that I will give (which is no fault of the hosts) is that the lake can be a little difficult to navigate if its your first time. This was my first time on the lake and I was a little nervous trying to find my way around. By the end of the week, I got the hang of it, but it took a full week before I got comfortable so make sure that you are confident in your boat driving and navigation skills.

superb apartment, fantastic views!
REVIEW: 
Have stayed in Palm Mar for over ten years, so know it well! Wanted a place that was quiet and not overlooked and this was perfect! Downstairs was beautifully furnished, everything we needed, internet excellent which is vital as we need it for work, and TV channels extensive. Upstairs terrace had superb sea views, although was very windy at times, and had the sun almost all day. Only small disappointment is that the cushions in the terrace furniture were dirty and old, but as we covered them with beach towels it did not matter. 
Loved it so much we tried to book for next year but not available for our dates.
Would not recommend for children due to being so high up, and this would be unsafe for them.

REVIEW: 
Property was on a hill with extensive views of mangawhai heads and estuary . Surf beach and estuary a short car trip away . Property is well equipped and although not fenced had a largeoutdoor deck whick could be closed off to allow dogs outside. However one gate on deck had to be tied shut as it blew open in windy conditions. We had a bit of wet weather and found the games room with table tennis and pool tables a bonus when we could not get out. I would not recommend the property for small children as the upstairs bedroom windows have no safety catches . The bunk beds are in a hallway between two bedrooms so are not private.

beautiful cabin but needs wirk
REVIEW: 
We LOVED the cabin, but definitely needs a deep cleaning and some major repairs. The size was perfect for my husband and I and the views were beautiful. The HUGE drawback was the shower and the cleanliness. The shower floor looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages and there was a crack in the floor fiberglass that looked like an unsuccessful repair was made. Depending on how long it’s been like this, I’d imagine the floor beneath is compromised and a major safety concern. The cabin is in desperate need of a deep cleaning. General floor areas were clean, but there was at least a quarter inch of dust on all baseboards and some fixtures. The stove burners had cooking debris that seemed to have been there awhile. The cabin has glass covers protecting the coffee tables that were disgusting underneath and on top. They are a safety concern if you bring any children because they don’t have sticky pads to hold them in place so they slide with the slightest bump. Bathroom mirrors looked like someone had taken a wet rag to clean them. 

Positive notes: Great location to all activities. The drive to the cabin is a little intense with steep inclines, but one you drive it a time or two, you get use to it. All linens were clean. We didn’t use the whirlpool tub due to not trusting the cleanliness, but we sure enjoyed the hot tub since we knew there were chemicals in it for disinfection. The cover for the hot tub isn’t the prettiest, but serves its purpose. We had a lot of fun with the pool table and retro arcade games. Gas grill worked, but had a little trouble with the ignition here and there. I’d recommend bringing a long lighter or matches in case it’s being temperamental during your visit. Also bring a dustpan/sweeper because there’s no cleaning supplies in the cabin. 

Would we stay there again? Not sure. Cabin size and amenities were perfect, but the property management that takes care of the cabin, Aunt Bugs rentals, seem to have the same bad reviews with their other cabins they rent out. I’d probably find another cabin that I wouldn’t feel the need to clean on vacation.

nice house, great location, beware of remax management company
REVIEW: 
Overall, This was a very well kept house and very convenient for our family. We booked this property because of location, amenities, and the pool. About 10 days prior to arrival I read a review that stated the pool was broke. I reached out to inquire and was told the owner has scheduled it to be fixed, with no date commitment. The previous renter was given a credit so I was not overly concerned. We show up and of course the pool is still broken, and drained except for about 1 foot of water at bottom, and no cover. Having small children with us made this dangerous and kept us from enjoying the lanai. When asked about the credit, Remax refused, and when I pushed back, received no response as to why. Also know that Remax will take a security deposit that is as much as a weeks rental and hold it for nearly two months. I did accept these terms, so caveat emptor. If you put this on a credit card, the interest can add up. I liked the property, but will never deal with a Remax managed property on VRBO again.

REVIEW: 
We've staying in a lot of rental homes and you can always tell when it's a home or if it's a business. This is a home. The second we walked in, we felt like we had arrived at our new home. I have a baby that loves to crawl upstairs and then fall down them and there were baby gates. The view was spectacular, the bedrooms were huge and so comfortable. We traveled with 3 families, 8 children. So. Many. Kids. And the house never felt cramped. The dining room table was large enough for us to all sit down and eat dinner together. the kitchen was stocked, we had plenty of everything we could need. We want to come back for every season. We came up to go sledding at Blackwater state park and this house was only 20 minutes away. It was perfect. Brian was an amazing host, he was prompt in his message responses and extremely accommodating. The kids never wanted to leave and neither did the adults. Can't wait to go back in the summer to enjoy the lake!

Die Hauptstraße direkt neben dem Haus war im Winter nicht schlimm, würde uns im Sommer aber stören und gefährlich sein die Kinder laufen zu lassen.

overwhelming fireplace smoke smell from the high winds outside was a problem
REVIEW: 
AMAZING location for skiing. The space worked well for us (3 adults + 1 child). The TVs have been updated to HD flat screens. Deck reconstruction is work-in-progress. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with high winds pushing fireplace smoke into the unit. If I came back again, I would find a different unit in Mountain Lodge without a fireplace.

More about the smell… For the first two days, there was an overwhelming, strong, unpleasant smell of fireplace smoke throughout the entire unit. The smell hit you like a wall of upon walking in the door. It made our eyes water. The smoke would be hazardous to an infant or asthmatic. There is no central HVAC (only radiant heat) so the only option to “air it out” was to open the exterior door/windows to sub-freezing high winds. We emailed the owners and they had no meaningful solutions. The building manager eventually came and she explained the wind-chimney phenomena. The phenomena is exacerbated if the units above/below use their fireplaces, which share a common chimney. The third day, mercifully, the wind died down outside and so did the smell. Our clothes stunk when we got home. It would be helpful for the owners to provide air purifiers w/HEPA filters. It smelled like we were living in a chimney.

The unit’s location in ML makes the sound from the common area of the lobby really carry into the bedrooms. If you are sensitive to noise when sleeping, find a different unit.

travelers beware - do not stay here!
REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early and will be fighting for a refund. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use Airbnb all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

regrettably disappointing
REVIEW: 
First, the positives: 
1) Jeffery, the online assistant on Vrbo was great at responding my questions when I had to reach out reg this rental. 
2) The house had a fenced in backyard, 4 small rooms, tile or vinyl floors, clean bathrooms and beds. 
3) Despite the fact that when you lookup the address on google maps, the first thing you see is several police cars and armed officers fully crashing on the house across the street… the neighborhood was quite and pleasing in person; only heard 9 gunshots coming from a house nearby, the night before we left. Side note, it was NOT on 4th of July or New Year’s, in case you wonder. 

Now, the negatives:
1) We did not receive any communication, confirmation email, property address or check-in instruction till WE reached out the night before taking off to this destination. We first tried calling the phone number provided but nobody answered and the VM was full. Then we finally got in contact with Jeff through Vrbo’s website to provide us with the info. 
2) The floors of the house were covered in a dark dust, as if you walked into an open-door restaurant in Manhattan, that stained everything that came in contact, from my dog’s paws to our luggage and anything else in between. The rugs and runners around the house were, as expected, also stained with this dark debris (or just dirty, it didn’t stop to check). I also found some sort of large bed cover inside the washer machine that smelled like cat urine (and No laundry detergent anywhere in the house). 
3) Cockroach – there were several juvenile live roaches found crawling around the bathtubs, laundry room, inside the dishwasher! We had to sleep with all the lights on to try to avoid waking up with roaches on the bed. To their defense, there were cracks between the ceilings and the walls, all around the house; understandably hard to keep pests out. 
4) The backyard did not have a volleyball net, but only a deflated ball around the bushes. There were pieces of glass and other debris that made the yard unsuitable/unsafe to let your pet (or other children) loose. Multiple areas with dog feces around the yard from previous residents. Only 1 garbage bag, no replacement bags, which did not help... 
5) Lastly, the guest bathroom had a small leak coming from the back of the toilet, that we noted only after we tried to flush the toilet. Needless to say, we had to close the outlet valve leading to the tank and mark that bathroom out-of-order.

great holiday getaway
REVIEW: 
We stayed here for 15 nights over Christmas, New Years and 3 Kings day. We had 6 adults, 2 children and a 9 month old. We had plenty of room. Property was beautiful. House does need a little TLC. There are multiple things broken or not working properly. It did not bother us though as we spent most of our time out or hanging at the club house. We had a lot of issues with the clubhouse picking up our trash (partly because of the holidays and partly because of laziness) I did notify the property manager as well as club house manager during our stay. We arrived Christmas Eve to trash overflowing the front box from previous tenants. This caused animals to dig through the trash that evening and we woke up to a huge mess that we had to clean up (someone else's garbage). Had to contact office to pick up trash on 3 separate occasions because they were not coming daily like they were supposed to. 

Some things that need attention in the house: microwave vent cover being held together with twisty ties, couches are super broken in (you need to sit on a pillow so you don't fall in), comforters on bed were extremely dirty and stained (we immediately stripped them off the beds and did not use them), beds are very low to the ground (did not bother us but was difficult for our parents getting in and out of bed) shower head seals broken in master bed room so you can't use one of the shower heads, handle in master bath broken in shower, master bedroom lamp broken, TV in master could not load any channels, and towels dirty upon arrival (which we had to wash prior to using), pool light did not be turn on and we had small ants in the upstairs bathrooms. Even with all that being said, we had a fabulous time and would stay here again. 

The property manager was great. She was quick to respond and went above and beyond by decorating for Christmas and setting up a tree for us (at my request). 

The clubhouse was fun and had a great little new years eve party by the pool that our family enjoyed. You do need to purchase your own key card for $20 if you don't want to wait in the line to get in the property. Sometimes the line was very long and depending on who was working would take much longer. Some requested to see your confirmation emails with your booking while other required your photo ID, some took time to write all your info down while others did not. We found it easier to just purchase the nonrefundable card after a couple of days waiting in the line. Everyone at the front gate was extremely friendly.

brand new beautiful house
REVIEW: 
We overall had a lovely time in this beautiful house. Excellent views and quiet neighborhood. Close drive to the ocean. Kitchen had everything that we needed, bedrooms all had tv's and comfortable beds. Excellent communication with owner and property manager. We were assured that the house would be ready for us as I had voiced my concerns about the fact that there were no photos of the interior on the website. There were a few unfinished items like wires hanging from the ceiling, and water not turned on to the dishwasher or washing machine which we needed to problem solve. The home is filled with floor to ceiling windows. Our son's bedroom was so bright and hot in the morning that he would wake up early and come into our room. Window coverings will help with this issue. Also, window coverings in the master bath and closet would be helpful, as I needed to keep the lights off so the neighbors would not be frightened when looking up. The pool water is cold and we had thought that there was a jacuzzi that would at least be warm. However, the jacuzzi only has jets, NO HEAT. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your home, we had a wonderful vacation!

REVIEW: 
This is the second time I stayed on this property, in a different unit. It was an anniversary getaway. So, I trusted that it would be a good experience. The unit that we were in had some major hiccups. But overall, it was a good weekend and a good getaway. If I stay there again, it won't be in Seahorse 2-B unless the major issues are fixed! It was a comedy of errors!

The issues: 
1. Inadequate heating. 
this was a major issue, in that the gas fireplace stopped working on our second night. The gas fireplace was the only source of heat for the large living room area. The property manager (who is stellar and the major reason why I didn't give this review a low rating!) came out after 9:30 p.m. at night, after I had been communicating with Vacasa for 1.5 hours with no success (I think I was talking to a robot). The property manager identified that the gas fireplace was not safe, after he had attempted to fix it (the odor of the gas was strong), and said he would bring a space heater by in the morning. We used a gas oven to heat the living room. Luckily there was a cadet heater in the bedroom, so we didn't freeze. he brought out a space heater the next day, and it served us well for the next two nights. The housekeepers and property managers were excellent in their response! I hope that they are paid well. The senior house keeper brought by extra blankets and communicated with us throughout the lack of heating. She suggested using the oven to heat the room, which turned out great! It felt like a fancy camping trip, but I had forgotten to bring any marshmallows to roast.

2. There is exposed wiring behind the refrigerator. No outlet plate cover. This is an easy fix. 
3. The outlet in the bathroom, beside the bathroom sink, is not grounded. Again, an easy fix.
4. Molding is being held together with masking tape. 
5. The IKEA dining chairs need to be repaired and tightened. They were very rickety.
6. The sofa has unstitched upholstery that needs repair. 
7. it wouldn't hurt to have calking around the windows, as we could feel the high winds. 
8. A brighter light bulb in the bathroom would be nice. 
9. Coat Hooks! There is absolutely no place to hang clothing in this unit. It would be a beautiful use of space if about 8 coat hooks were installed in the hallway. 

I'm giving a huge shoutout to Anita, Tim, and Nathan, who were stellar in their support! The property managers and housekeeping staff are amazing!

REVIEW: 
It started with us arriving in the early evening and it was 32° outside and I had my twin 18 month old grandsons with me, the front door law had been broken and not been fixed. It took us over 45 minutes to work with Vacasa to finally get into the house, the trash had not been picked up and was completely full and also the owners had stayed previously and it had not been clean. They were long black hair strands throughout the house. They were exposed wires on the living room floor, which I have no idea what they were. The heating is atrocious, part of the house is burning hot, and the rest is freezing . Vacasa is the worst management, and. I did a review and they will not post it every time you call Vacasa you get a different person from.
I would not recommend this property for anyone

unfavorable!
REVIEW: 
This is our 1st & only unfavorable VRBO review after many 5 star bookings. We vacated 2 days early due to poor conditions. 
The entrance was at the back, was dark, cluttered & had a crumbling cement stairs. Out front had bags of garbage and toilets to be disposed of for two days after we arrived. The living room had poor lighting, had missing bulbs & the room was still dark after they replaced a bulb. It was too dark to read a book without a flashlight. One sconce was hanging by wires off the wall. The floor was unfinished between the kitchen & living room causing a tripping hazard. The kitchen light didn't work causing us to have to use our cell phone flashlights to see. One hall light flickered the whole time it was on. The noisy sliding BR doors were very hard to open and close. There were no closets or hooks anywhere to hang clothes in the bedrooms or the entrance to hang a coat. There wasn't enough hot water to take a ""quick"" shower. The windows had bars, ""not pictured"" on the listing. The windows and curtains were filthy. The kitchen counters and coffee pot had not been cleaned. The kitchen had water stained & sagging ceiling tiles. We would, periodically, smell sewer gas.
We did communicate with the manager during our stay. They did address replacing a couple light bulbs, however, the rooms remained dark and no light in the kitchen. She was sending our complaint with pictures we took, to the owner however, we have not heard anything back from the owner even 5 days later which is careless on his part. We regret that we paid $896.57 for 5 nights.

i wanted to love this place
REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stay in a rental property. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

It was honestly just rundown… We stayed one night and then left two days earlier to stay at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. After two hours on the phone with VRBO we were able to get some of our money back for the other two nights.

REVIEW: 
I have stayed in the Old San Juan area many times, always in a VRBO. There are always some quirks with buildings that are as old and historic as these. I have never had a complaint or a bad experience until this time. 

The troubles started at check in. VRBO sent me an email with the apartment number and a door code. The owner sent me a text with a different apartment number and a different door code. I texted back that VRBO had sent me different information and verified that I should use the VRBO information. When I entered the apartment, there was someone staying there. I then asked the owner if I should go to the other unit, to which they replied I should and asked if I had the code (that they had just sent me). 

I entered that unit and looked around. It was nothing like the photos but I had dinner plans and did not have time to do a thorough inspection. I had some business that evening and the following morning, so I tried to connect to the wifi using the instructions provided. The network name provided did not appear, so I texted the owner. They responded quickly and said that someone would be out that night to repair it. No one ever showed up. I spoke to the occupant of the other unit and he said that he had not had wifi for his time there and was repeatedly told someone would come by to fix it. He was staying for a month and had not seen anyone come to fix it. 

When I returned from dinner I texted that the wifi was still not working and was told ""there is a green light on the box so it is good"" there is no box or a green light and the network name would appear only occasionally. When it did appear the multiple passwords that I was given did not work.

I did a more thorough inspection of the unit on my return. I found the tables and counters were sticky in spots, There was a used washcloth on the kitchen counter, the cabinet doors were on crooked and did not stay closed, the floors, walls, light switches, and shower were filthy. The toilet seat had only one bolt and slid off the stool when sat on, the rear door was duct taped closed but you could see light coming through. There were cords and exposed wires allover the unit. There was broken conduits with the wires exposed, electrical boxes duct taped closed and air conditioners that did not cool the unit down to below 75 degrees after 5 hours. The final straw for me was when I pulled back the covers on the bed to see that the sheets were stained in spots with a dark substance.

REVIEW: 
Honestly one of the nicest condos we have rented. Everything was as per the description. Very comfortable bedding (thank you), we’ll equipped, calphalon cookware and actually sharp knives! Walking distance to the gondola and can ski back even closer. Shuttle service is very helpful and don’t need a car. Hot tubs were HOT which was great after a day on the slopes. 
Would have gotten 5 stars if not for the following: 
- kitchen lighting is terrible. So poorly lit, makes it feel like you are prepping by the light of a flashlight. 
- One of the bedroom lamps was broken 
- The dishwasher has a lower tray that constantly rolls off the rail, and is so close to the drawer for the trash that you usually can’t open the door because the trash door hasn’t closed completely. 
- Toilet in the master would teeter when sitting on it. 
- Smoke detector dangling from wires in the hallway. 
- Shuttle service is very slow. While they will take you anywhere, when they say 15-20 min, expect more like 30 min. Still, cheaper than an Uber. 
- can hear neighbors upstairs, but not intrusive 
Overall though, it was a great place to stay and I would recommend it.

REVIEW: 
This property was exactly as it was advertised. We enjoyed our long weekend getaway with family and friends. The house does need some maintenance (door handles loose, broken doors on the downstairs entrainment center and dresser in master bedroom, and all the wall electrical plugs were all loose. Also the grill was rusted and in bad shape.. yes we did grill while visiting after having to get a grill cleaning kit). 

As far as Massanutten resort- wish I could say we enjoyed it but that is not the case. Purchasing tickets for snow sports is extremely difficult. Also- the Saturday we were there, a private rental closed the mini golf, GoKarts, and other activities. Not ideal in peak winter season. The slopes were so packed and just all around not the best experience of the resort itself.
The property served its purpose but we will not be returning to Massanutten Resort. 
For the host- easy check-in and effortless reservation process. Thank you!

The location is incredible - just a few minutes from shops, restaurants, casinos, Heavenly and the lake. The house is actually quite spacious and having the garage to park in was a huge bonus because we didn’t have to defrost and scrape snow off the car. Plenty of towels provided and the kitchen was fully supplied in terms of cookware etc. The hot tub worked wonderfully and we did enjoy our stay however the house could use some TLC. Nothing major, just dated and a little dingy, dings in the walls, old carpet, chipping floor in shower. Pool sticks were old and broken, closets and drawers had some junk in them, loose wires sticking out of walls. All that being said we’d stay here again for the purpose we needed becuase of the location, the hot tub and the space!

REVIEW: 
This is an older park model trailer. It’s nothing fancy, and has several issues, but it is clean and well supplied. 

 The resort is very nice. And the location is close to many places of interest. 

We had some difficulty and confusion at check in. The key is in a lock box that we struggled to get I open Once we did get into it we tried to open the door that the box was hanging from, but it would not open. We then discovered the key fit the sliding door. Small thing, but it was kind of frustrating after a day of travel. Then it became clear that the other door was another room that we did not have access to. Not a big deal, just would have liked to know this before hand. Nice backyard that we did not get to use because we were only there a short time. The small front porch had overgrown vines and dirty chairs. There was rain recently so maybe the host had not had a chance to clean them yet. 

If you’re just needing a place to land at night and don’t need luxury accommodations, this will be fine. It’s not fancy. There’s an unsightly tangle of wires hanging below the television. And using the television was confusing. If you’re cooking you have to step into the hallway in order to get into the refrigerator. The binder with information was just three pages and was not a great help. 

It was just ok.

We were told someone would complete a home inspection the next day at 11 am. We stayed until 2:30 and until this day no one has followed up regarding outlr poor experience. The home does offer a beautiful sunrise if you enjoy that. We had to take our personal items from and to the home when temporarily leaving due to unsure how secure the front door was. My fiance got in using a credit card when he tested it prior to temporarily leaving. It destroyed the card of course.... Have photos to submit but there is not an option. This includes the beautiful sunrise Sunday morning.

read before booking pleeeeeease!
REVIEW: 
Let me just start of by saying that from booking I understood this property was old and not updated by all means BUT that has Nothing g to do with cleanliness! This house was DIRTY. I am talking cob webs everywhere, food crumbs everywhere, dead bugs all over.. hair from previous renters… linens smelled like body musk, kitchen was dirty and pots and pans and utensils were all dirty… . It was bad. When we arrived and saw this, I immediately called owner and she was very quick to respond but was surprised that the house was dirty. She said she never had this issue and that the last time the house had any guest was a few months ago… and that’s the last time the house had been cleaned. In my opinion and if I was in her shoes and I knew I had guest coming I would have the house cleaned!!!!!!!! I do have to say that the owner did send the cleaning lady to see the house but when she arrived all she said was that she cleaned and did her job and there was nothing else she could do. She offered Lysol for me to spray on the linens….. LOL!!! Then I called the owner and she offered to refund us 2 nights for the dirty house. By the time it was time for bed we noticed there was NO hot water… oh my god. NO hot water in January!!!!! We tried everything and couldn’t fix it… So again called the owner and she said her parents had went to turn the hot water off so the pipes wouldn’t freeze a few months ago.. (she failed to inform us of this before check in) she also said they had put antifreeze in toilets so the water wouldn’t freeze (what in the world???) she said she would call the plumber in the morning… so that night we had no hot water and had to boil some water for the kids to take a bath. The plumber did not show up till after 3pm… 
Thankfully he was able to fix it but he did say the way the lines and wires are in the front of the house was weird and dangerous… also all the beds were SUPER loud and old… this house definitely needs some maintenance and DEEP cleaning!!! These are just things a paying guest should not have to worry about. Period. The rest of our stay was just ugh. We had to stick it out because we came from Puerto Rico and my family came from New York and Raleigh and we had no where to go… the only up side was the out side… loved it!!!! The kayaking and the swing was nice! We did enjoy that and the fire pit! The house was awful and could not recommend.

Listening said 2 king beds and there was only 1. 
Found Moldy humidifier
Door Locks not explained . One child locked themselves in room and could not get out. 
Poor lighting really need to be updated 
Hanging light in family room unsafe hangs down an a person can and did hit head. 
Unsafe lights above kitchen sink broken bases of bulbs in 2 sockets . Lights flickering.
Not that expensive or challenging to replace those fixtures with led fixtures 
Stairwell lights didn’t work and created an unsafe walkway. I am not paying to replace bulbs in fixtures I can’t even open. 
No broom!
Nail protruding on step I found a hammer and was able to hit it in. 
Glass table legs move and the glass top is very heavy and unsafe
Smoke alarm wires hanging in entry way and no alarm.
Curtains didn’t fully cover the windows.
Great location but the place needs an upgrade especially lighting and other items listed above.

REVIEW: 
The unit we stayed in was unsafe and we called and texted Vacasa, but no “local team” ever came out to fix the exposed wiring and electrical issues. Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building. We rented a wonderful unit at Tyra last year, great experience, great owner and service - but knowing that this unsafe unit is now in the Tyra complex makes us feel uncomfortable about staying at any Tyra unit again.

Our condo was lovely. May we offer these suggestions? Have the property manager check it before guests arrive. We had several issues. For a week we had no access to tv. The cable had been removed from the back of the unit? Our shower didn’t have a light; it had a hole in the ceiling with wires dangling from it. Most certainly a safety issue.

accurate to the listing, but needs work
REVIEW: 
The description is accurate as far as the unit and what is in it. But it needs a full tear out and rebuild. Patio doors don’t close, cable boxes simply hanging by their cords. Only one tv remote for the four units in the building, we were only two people using one bedroom, but still a pain. Communicated with someone at the of a text line (always someone different) and they sent a note to a local rep, who responded, but never showed up with remotes. 
Everything worked, but the sofa was so old that we sank to the frame, so moved patio chairs inside. This wasn’t our first time in Casa, and friends are still there in another unit, with newer decor and furniture that can be used. 
I just cannot recommend this unit, until it has the doors fixed, the floors levelled and the ducting cleaned, because the patio doors didn’t seal tight we were having to run the furnace, which caused throat irritation to us and our friends when they visited. I have photos if needed.

REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Several lights were not working (one hanging from its cable). Microwave was non-functional when we arrived, but they brought another that was placed on the countertop. TVs are small, antiquated, and difficult to operate. 1 room doorknob was broken.

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stays in an Airbnb or VBRO. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

This is truly a 3rd world property! The only thing that really worked well was the A/C. Everything needs a re-do! Toilet's don't flush right. We had sewer odors or perhaps methane gas odors from lack of vents or vents that don't work well. (Our's were minor in comparison to my sister and brother in-law's unit that was almost unbearable the whole time). Delry the manager is ok. He at least pretends to be glad he's there. The housekeepers were very good and hard working (and I'd bet severely underpaid. Beds need replacement (box springs torn, old and dirty). The bicycles for rent were never really available. Electrical wiring is surface mounted in some areas and probably not safe. Ceiling fan in the bathroom is not installed within the ceiling as designed to be and therefore is extremely noisy and annoying. The only lamp (other than a too bright, ceiling mounted florescent tube (open and exposed and with exposed wiring) was a flexible tube desk lamp with a horrible green shade that made the room green. The bathroom sink is rusty, the bathtub has been spray painted and paint is coming off. On the last day the water heater failed and so we took cold showers. The outdoor little palapa-type-awning-area must have been nice at one time but it's just totally beat up as are the picnic tables. Caye Caulker was AMAZING! But VRBO should remove this nasty property from their offerings! We thought... it's VRBO... it must be decent! It WAS less $ - But it's a slum!

REVIEW: 
Where to begin? When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here.

The good - easy to get to and check in. Lots of bedding options, towels and linen. Enjoyed the family games and staples in the pantry. Not so good - the wonderful view was blocked by vehicles parked out front, the double bed was quite uncomfortable, some TLC is needed in the property with fittings (broken and uncovered light sockets/exposed wiring) and some items fell/broke due to poor attachments to plaster (owner repaired when contacted). Couldn't see a fire alarm and the oven kept tripping the fuse box/power off when used. The owner was easy to contact on Stayz and while not living nearby, had a neighbour who was available if needed. Instructions for the use of the appliances would have been helpful, also some fishing rods or beach gear that we might borrow. Was overpriced for a shack but overall a fairly pleasant stay.

REVIEW: 
Upon arriving, we found a note from the host that the furnace had quit working the day before our arrival. And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues.

REVIEW: 
The house is in a great, quiet location. The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat. The property manager and owner said to leave the bedroom doors open and there are also 2 space heaters to heat the main areas. The space heaters were way to small to make a difference and the main areas were quite cold. None of the living room lights worked nor the living room fan, the pool was filthy, master bedroom faucet was loose, no cable, so no live TV, no garage door transmitters and the shower water pressure was not good. Due to having no heat in the main areas, we would not stay there again. We could look past all of the other issues, but with the main areas too cold to be in, we will look at other properties for our next visit.

The property was nothing like what was pictured. The home was dirty, windows didn’t close, door/window screens littered with holes, electrical wiring was exposed throughout the home. Both the front and back doors don’t completely close, a quarter inch gap exists to let the light and bugs through. Broken tile and holes in the wall throughout the home. The bathroom tiling was so shoddy that the owner didn’t bother to tile underneath the vanity which stood on four legs and thus exposing the floor boards. The pool area was filthy, the decomposing solar cover littered the pool with plastic. Think twice before booking.

REVIEW: 
My wife and I had a wonderful time in PV, and enjoyed staying in PH6. The check-in process, with Javier (PVRPV) was flawless, despite our late arrival (thank you, Volaris). The unit was clean and fully furnished, and the view from the balcony/patio really nice.

The only negatives were mostly beyond the owners control: way too few outlets (only 2 in the kitchen and none near the counter where one might use a laptop); slippery tiles by the pool; inconsistent maid service (we found towels in the dryer, despite being there 8 nights the sheets were not changed, and we were left to fold the towels after the maid service during the week). We found the cupboards too high, by Javier acquired a step stool (gracias), and the unit could use more towel hooks in the bathrooms (an easy Home Depot fix).

All of the appliances worked really well, and the unit did not lack for any. We found music on the TV system by accessing YouTube via the Roku. We found an extension cord, which we used in the kitchen for a 3rd outlet - a great fix). The beds were very comfortable, the pillows great too, and the A/C units were both easy to use and very efficient.

All-in-all, a great stay - thank you so much for sharing your condo with us. ATBster

Again, the house has so much potential with a more work and thought put into it.

Management was very responsive and helpful, resolving minor issues quickly and even providing advice/suggestions about the area. Kihei is great, although keep in mind it is about a 30-45+ drive to any of the other areas on the island you may want to visit (unless visiting Wailea).

Unfortunately for families with children, this condo complex is geared more towards retirees with many rules restricting activities and encouraging quiet on the property. Normally not a big deal to comply with, however there were several days during our stay when ocean conditions were not safe so we were unable to use the pool and grassy areas on property as a backup activity plan. 

Luckily Maui has many options to keep kiddos occupied but I wish the listing would have been more clear about the on property restrictions that could impact families traveling with small children.

REVIEW: 
My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Again, my review: 0/10

good, but should have and could be better
REVIEW: 
The size of this location was very good for 6 people. The view & location were excellent. There was NEVER a shortage of towels, for both bathrooms & the pool. Nice job there!
There were a few minor things that the owner should fix when you are paying $4,000+ for a week. 
The sliding pocket door leading to bathroom in master bedroom needs leveled. 
Most of the sliding doors leading to the pool deck need to be lubricated; easy for adults to slide but not seniors. 
The light in the laundry room needs a new ballast, takes forever to come on at times. The clothes dryer takes too long to dry a simple load of towels.
The AC unit in the master bedroom needs recharged/serviced. We set to 70 degrees & it never went below 73 for an entire week. 
The handle in the master bedroom sink came right off in our hands. Simple plastic piece underneath broke off. 
The other sink in the BR had cold handle faucet that wouldn't turn off. It would just spin around. So you had to have it just right for the water to stop. 
The toilet in the other bathroom leaked slowly onto the floor. 
The garage door opener worked but it wouldn't engage the door itself. In other words, we couldn't use the garage. When it was 80+ degrees, would have been nice to get the cars out of the sun. 
So all of the above were minor in nature & owner needs to address but nothing that we were so upset with that we needed a service call. It's the little things in life that we didn't stress over. But these things need to be fixed. 
Finally we come to the pool & the hot tub. When we arrived, the water level in the pool was approx. 12-15"" low. Low enough in fact that the pool would not heat because it fell below the skimmer. There were garden hoses on either side of the pool which we used to refill the water. Took a good number of hours to refill that much water and get the heater to come on. 
The hot tub was also about 8-9"" low. Since it only held 4 people, fast to refill. 
But we learned that you cannot heat the pool & the hot tub at the same time. Maybe that is how all pool heaters work, but it was a pain to heat the pool for hours, then we had to turn that off & then heat the HT.
Finally every morning we had to refill the HT. It was bone-dry. The pump would come on and shoot water everywhere. We had to refill that everyday. That was a terrible inconvenience.
Lastly, there are ungodly amount of light switches. It would be nice to label them ALL. 
Nice visit but has to be better than this for the cost

The home and neighborhood are lovely. The house was extremely clean and had everything we needed for a snowy weekend getaway. The kitchen was fully stocked and easy to cook all meals.

I really loved the location of this house it was absolutely perfect. We loved that there were two living rooms and kitchen where we could separate the kids and adults. The kids enjoyed the pool and at the end of the trip the adults enjoyed the hot tub. Chris is a wonderful host who always answers all my questions. My only suggestion is that the floors get very slippery outside by the pool and inside walking in. We loved all the baby stuff included at the house that was wonderful for our 6 month old and all the pool toys for the older kids. 
Thanks for a great month and a wonderful vacation.

great condo for our first family maui vacation
REVIEW: 
Karen’s condo was great for our family of 6. You can tell she has pride of ownership and high standards for maintaining her condo. It was clean, well equipped (except we couldn’t find the first aid kit when my 3 year old fell at the pool but friends we made while there had one) There was no chance of running out of anything she had all paper products / soaps well stocked. Having the pool so close was perfect and my girls spent many hours swimming in the rain which we unfortunately had a lot of but it was so great to have the pool to keep them busy. It was really nice to have beach toys, towels, chairs and coolers to use for our beach days. The washer and dryer was used daily and was nice to keep on top of laundry. My only personal complaint was the requirement to wash / dry all the towels before we left. With 4 kids it was a bit hectic and we had to time an early morning final swim to have enough time to launder all the towels. Everyone with kids knows one trip to the pool is 6 pool towels and then 6 bath towels so even though there is adequate towels it’s 2 loads of laundry just in towels which takes some time. We took full advantage of the BBQ area and the condo grounds was well maintained. We really liked that you could walk to the shops. We wouldn’t hesitate to book Karen’s beautiful place again on our next trip Maui.

disappointing! bugs, mould, run down!
REVIEW: 
We stayed at this property for a week in Dec of 2022. The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.

REVIEW: 
We loved this place. All the necessary utensils and cookware to cook for our family and even for baking a cake for my wife’s birthday. 
The bed was very comfortable and they kids enjoyed the pullout sofa. This place has 3 pullout sofas and a bed. So you have a lot of sleeping options. There is also 3 big screen tv’s, one in each room. More than enough towels and paper products for a family of 4 for 4 nights. Has a nice view of the pool and hot tubs and it was nice to see the steam coming off the water as the snow fell. It can get pretty windy at the top of snowshoe and we have stayed in other units where you didn’t want to go out on the balcony. But this unit’s balcony is somewhat protected by the winds. If your looking for a place in snowshoe, Allegheny is the best place to stay!! They have 2 hot tubs and a heated pool, cheat mountain pizza is located in the bottom of the building, ski lockers, nice lobby with a tv and fireplace, free entry to split rock (pool/hot tubs/kids water slides), 1 min walk, great location at one end of the village and your right there at the top of ballhooter lift. 
We are looking forward to staying here again!

great heated pool house on a lake 5.6 mi to venice & 17mi to saint armands circle
REVIEW: 
This home has been updated recently. From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.
You will enjoy your stay at the Nokomis pool house.

spacious but missing details
REVIEW: 
Overall the location was great, the rooms were spacious, the backyard is nice and the hot tub is large. There are some areas of easy improvement that should be noted: 

Cons:
- Cabinets don't close properly in kitchen
- Not enough towels to do hot tub AND shower (would need 2 per person, only put out 1)
- Only 1 roll of crappy paper towels when every place i've rented provides at least 2
- Hot Tub has some sort of slippery film across the entire thing (inside), causing many of us to slip and bruise easily
- No ziplocks, plastic wrap or foil provided like all other rentals provide (only two medium tupperwares available)
- Bar stools were wobbly, needing to be replaced
- Access to the backyard is ONLY through the main bedroom, no access from main/upper area so we often had to let the dogs go to the bathroom out front instead
- The binder with all the house information was inaccurate - it provided a picture of the thermostat and rules for heating when it was not that thermostat at all. There's 1 heater total for both upstairs and down so drastic temperature change when going up and down
- Bear Box for trash was broken so had to leave trash in garage with previous renter's trash

Pros:
- Location is great: 9 mins to Heavenly California main lodge / also downtown / to lakeside
- Main living areas were spacious, most bedrooms were ok/small with main bedroom massive with fireplace
- Easy check-in
- Can park 2 in garage, 2 in driveway

REVIEW: 
Upon glass on the floor broken. arrival, a large window in the main living space was broken- really broken - like glass on the floor still broken. It was obvious someone had been out to slap a piece of plywood on it but there was a considerable draft , glass on the floor and in the crevices of the fireplace and NO dustpan to be found for clean up. It was snowing and about 18 degrees. I immediately started calling the management company but after remaining on hold for 20 minutes which was enough time to hear the timbertop jingle enough times to memorize it! I went and bought a dust pan at the local store , placed some plastic wrap over the window and shoved a chair against it to help with the draft since we had babies and small children arriving. . I tried to contact the property manager by email and was unable to contact anyone that way either. One of the King size beds was actually a double. The refrigerator looked like someone tool a shot gun to it, The lampshade in the living room was shredded. The 4 ammenities -hot tub,- (smelled funky) pool(slimy bottom), pool table (no tips on sticks- no chalk) and theater room(would not connect to surround sound) all had issues. We were missing an entire shower curtain in one of the bathrooms, the dryer didn't dry(heating element?) and a towel rack promptly fell off the wall when a towel was applied. I was able to contact the company the second night of our stay and they sent someone out the 3rd night. We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic. After hearing the issues they offered less than 10% discount for our trouble. This was not the luxury cabin experience our family Christmas celebration was expecting .

Some posts have said that you can walk down to the resort below in the marina, but that walkway is locked off with a gate. The house could use some books on St Croix. The pool could use hand rails to get in, given the steps are really steep. Great coffee set up - an neurogenic machines, a regular coffee maker, a grinder and even a milk foamer! We enjoyed a drink at the Buccaneer Lounge and a snorkeling trip with Llewelyn on a catamaran. Duggans Reef and Great Salt Pond were wonderful dinners. Shoy beach is nice and quiet but it was too windy to snorkel there.

REVIEW: 
Overall not very impressed by this property or the complex. It was reasonably priced but I won’t be staying at this complex again. 

Property: If I owned the place then the property manager would be fired instantly. There were bent frying pans, all the knifes are dull, no dishwasher detergent provided, etc. Most of the extra storage closets are locked so storing skis & boards is difficult without being crammed. The place overall feels very dated, the pictures make it look much nicer. Rooms were a decent size & beds are were comfortable but that’s about the extent of the good things. If you want to hot tub after, you’ll need to drive. 

Complex: This is the only place I’ve ever stayed at that doesn’t allow drinks (including water, which is a safety hazard IMO) into the hot tub area. I understand glass but having a beer in the tub after skiing all day is a staple for most people. There’s literally a guy checking as you enter the lobby to make sure you don’t have any drinks, and won’t even allow you to bring water to the locker room. He also closed down earlier than advertised so make sure to get there early. It felt more like being at church summer camp than on a ski vacation. Location is decent though, short drive to the lake & about 30 mins to the slopes. 

Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else, there’s much better options in the area.

TITLE: 
wheelchairs, poor maintenance & no front desk help
REVIEW: 
The property itself was nice but maintenance had been neglected. The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us.

REVIEW: 
This place was in a great location beautiful home and it was quiet clean to some standards but not to mine. There was blood stain on master bed pillow case. The shower was rinsed out not cleaned like should be. Windex works great on mirrors and all surfaces clean the mirrors and pictures. Should clean with HOT Water not cold nor slightly warm. The hot water heater must had been turned on 70 degrees because we never had hot water. The worst part was when the main breaker tripped and water heater breaker was the only one tripped with it. From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked. We came here for my daughters bday weekend to celebrate her bday and all our plans were ruined Saturday waiting on maintenance man to arrive (who agreed with me and said he had been telling them to get an electrician out there in the past) andfor the agency to call me to see if they were going to place us in a different home. My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties. Especially when you break the law and allow is to stay here when you already knew about the main breaker tripping issue and the water heater issue. I want a refund.

TITLE: 
what a disappointment!
REVIEW: 
The villa is in a very quiet residential neighbourhood with partial sea views. It is freshly painted, has a nice driveway and an attractive garden. Inside is a different story to the extent we have lodged an official complaint with VRBO.
We booked the villa a year in advance of our stay of 3 weeks in January 2023 on the basis of - to quote from the villa’s site - “completely renovated (end of works April 2019) and “a completely new kitchen and very well equipped.” These statements are totally untrue.
The kitchen is the same kitchen that was there in January 2014, some 9 years ago! Same cupboards, fridge, well used and grubby utensils and utensils’ box, rusty dangerous kettle (the steam pours out of the on/off switch where your hand goes.) and a filthy waste bin area. Random grubby and useless items were in the kitchen drawers. The gas hob had one non functioning and alarming ring which we had to avoid.
We have supplied VRBO with photographic evidence of all these comments.
The site quotes “sheets, linen and towels are hotel quality”. This was not the case - bed linen was thin and of poor quality and we were expected to have the same sheets throughout our 3 week stay as no clean ones were provided until we insisted the cleaner came and unlocked the cupboard the sheets were locked in.
No information/instruction folder was to be found on arrival which is essential when trying to settle in to a new home.

REVIEW: 
I booked and paid for a two bed, two and a half bath condo for 4 adults, one couple and two other adults, so we needed 3 beds. The third bed listed in the description of the property a sofa sleeper/futon bed which I planned for my adult children to take turns sleeping on. We arrived at the property at 1AM on Sunday morning. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the couch and chair in the living room were neither sleeper sofas nor futons and were not big enough for a 10 year old child to sleep on much less a full grown adult! I found a phone number for the host and texted him asking if we had been given the wrong condo as I was very specific with him prior to our trip that we needed a third bed. He never once said that the 3rd bed was an air mattress that needed to be blown up after we arrived, but this is what he texted me in the wee hours of the morning after we arrived! I could not even find the mattress until the next morning as the closet where it was stored was in a bedroom where my son had already gone to bed. I found the mattress the next morning and when I blew it up the air rushed out through a giant hole in the seam! I called the host and he insisted that it was standard that the 3rd bed was an air bed...never disclosed on VRBO, much less expected when you are booking a vacation property as opposed to an Air B and B. Later that day he had Instacart drop off a new bed. The new bed needed batteries in order to use the pump provided with the bed, however the batteries were not included...stated right on the front of the box..batteries not included! Meanwhile, I filed a complaint with VRBO about the bait and switch in the property description. They finally agreed to rebook us in a different property, but only if the host cancelled our current booking! I went back and forth via text with the host insisting he cancel our booking and he refuseed. I requested he at least refund the cleaning and service fees and he still refused. He then started referring to the fourth person in our party as an ""extra guest"". I booked and paid for 4 adults and specifically requested accommodation with 3 beds. I was never once told the third bed would be an old air mattress with a giant hole in it! The carpet throughout the unit is filthy dirty, the ceiling fans were filthy dirty , the stove and microwave were either really dirty of damaged, there was a giant smear of greas on the cabinet over the microwave. There were holes in walls and dents in doors

REVIEW: 
Pros - nice infinity swimming pool, close to the beach, great views of the beach & sea, many bars/restaurants to choose from in the downtown core

Cons - Arrived Saturday night, had great difficulty finding a driving route to the property, as many roads in the area were closed off (which is a nightly occurrence). It would’ve been nice to have known this beforehand, and given driving instructions to bypass the numerous road closures. Very noisy locale, given the many bars and in the area - music was blaring till 2 AM every night. The room suite itself was OK, but dated. Barbeque was rusted and ancient. Glass range cooktop was significantly damaged with very large cracks in the surface (a small, portable electric burner was provided). The built-in microwave was also not working (a small, portable microwave was also provided). As is common with other resorts and condominium properties, finding a poolside lounge chair can be daunting if you’re not up early and reserving one for yourself (even though you are instructed not to reserve a chair and leave it for an hour or more, nobody follows that rule…and on-site security doesn’t enforce it).

REVIEW: 
Upon arriving, we found a note from the host that the furnace had quit working the day before our arrival. And the home was quite cold. When contacting the host was told I was exaggerating that the house was freezing on arrival, that it had to be at least 60 degrees downstairs & 70 upstairs. It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them. The downstairs had no smoke alarm and the barrel fire place down there got extremely hot. The ceiling tiles had been wet throughout and starting to fall in. The pictures are deceiving. This home presents a huge fire hazard with all the electrical issues.

REVIEW: 
Where to begin? When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here.

REVIEW: 
This property overall was a bit of a disappointment because we were told that the original house we had booked had water or electricity damage so we had chose another. This house is very eccentric indeed and quite outdated which made it feel quite dusty and grimy. We will not be dealing with Algarve Vacations in future. It was ridiculous that we had to pay extra to use a baby cot and high chair (after we were made to change houses!). In addition, 130 euros of our deposit was not returned for some coffee stains on sheets that apparently wouldn't come out in the wash. We have no way of knowing if they tried and no way of disputing it to try to get the money back.

TITLE: 
amazing ocean-front view from spacious balcony
REVIEW: 
This is an older condo with older furniture and amenities but nicely kept. We enjoyed our 10 day stay. Fish Market across the street with fresh caught fish daily. Food truck court just down the street was fun. Other small eateries and coffee shops within walking distance. Grass area with beach chairs/lounges with the waves pounding the wall in front of you. The unit's location to beachfront is hard to beat.
However, here are some observations about the condo. 
The photographer did an amazing job of making the unit look twice the size it actually is. 
Balcony and living areas are comfortable and spacious compared to the rest of the unit.
Bathroom area with shower is small but adequate for two people, not more. 
Kitchen is very small but has a full size range and microwave. No oven, but we didn't go there to make Thanksgiving dinner! Small toaster oven is provided but would not fit even a small pizza. Cooking utensils were minimal. Not many drinking glasses, especially plastic ones for the beach.
Bedroom featured a king-size captain's bed that filled the room. If you are shorter than 6 feet tall or have trouble climbing and jumping you might have trouble getting into the bed. My wife is 5 feet tall and I had to pull her into bed each night. It is comfortable once you are in it, but hard to get into. Very little room to move around the bed. We had to move a couple of items out of the room to make it easier to get around the bed. Closet is adequate size with hangers and shelves, and the captain's bed has large drawers that pull out for storing items, but they are hard to access because of how close the bed is to the walls.
Laundry facilities were easy to use and located on all levels except the first level.
Getting to the small beach in front of the break wall was difficult due to damaged stairways on both ends of the property. The damage, likely from storms, is bad enough that the stairs are fenced off. Access to the beach is by climbing down the 4-5 foot wall made of lava rock, not something everyone will be able to do. A short walk north along the street takes you to a nice public access beach where you can spend the day or just walk back through the tidepools to the front of the Paki Maui property.
Pool area was nicely outfitted with gas grills. Spa was warm and comfortable. Pool is not heated so it was not comfortable to be in (we visited in January) unless you are from Minnesota, in which case you would probably love it!
Several maintenance items had been overlooked and we hope they are repaired for the next visitor (all reported to property manager). Bathroom sink drained painfully slow. Kitchen faucet was wobbly and not properly attached to the counter top. Microwave control buttons for lights/fan were loose and hard to operate. Towel rack inside shower had been previously broken and poorly repaired requiring us to continually put it back in place.
Again, overall we enjoyed ou stay at Paki Maui but found the attention to detail for a property priced at this level to be lacking. Next visit we would choose a different property. We hope this helps those considering this unit.

REVIEW: 
Stayed here for a weekend with friends. The house could use some TLC, but the picture windows, lake view, hot tub and multilevel deck more than compensated for the less-than-perfect interior. The inside is comfortable—great room upstairs was an excellent “hangout” spot and the pool and football tables downstairs were fun. It was fairly clean but did have some cobwebs in corners and dust bunnies/crumbs under beds. Some finishing touches that would make it better: trash cans in all bathrooms, fix loose towel racks, put handles/knobs on all kitchen cabinets (especially under sink), paint the spots where drywall has been patched, consider some basic instructions for use of kitchen appliances, TV and gas fireplace. But overall, we had a nice time here and there was plenty of room for 4 couples.

We recently rented this property for a family of 7. While the property itself has many good features, presents nicely and the property managers responded quickly to problems as they arose, we were confronted with a number of concerning issues which we spent valuable holiday time dealing with quite apart from the total inconvenience of the maintenance failures eg the dishwasher failed on the first usage & leaked into the downstairs (dishwasher hose & associated electrics- rodent damage), 3 beds at least did not have fresh sheets and had sand etc in them (too late at night to involve property managers), batteries to 2 fans needed replacing and fire alarm battery needed replacing after dishwasher leak. The one upstairs toilet had a very unpleasant & obvious smell. The downstairs ensuite accommodation (a room off the converted garage) does not have an opening window in the bedroom or a fan, the nearby kitchenette could at least provided glasses for water- it is totally empty of any utensils. Not really a pleasant alternative space for grandparents!

beautiful house but unclean and run down
REVIEW: 
This was the second time we had stayed at Kingfisher Heights but in two different houses. We had high expectations based on the pictures of the house and our first stay. With the experience I have in the travel & tourism industry, I am used to reviewing properties. Unfortunately, Sandy Escape did not meet expectations. The following were the main issues:
 - The property was quite unclean with piles of dirt left in the downstairs bathroom. 
 - We advised there would be 10 adults staying but were only provided with 7 bath towels, even though information states bath towels are provided for all guests. 
 - Only 2 burners on the 6 burner stove work. 
 - The ice or cold water dispenser in the fridge did not work. 
 - The media/tv room on the first floor was very dirty with stains on the couch and the blinds unable to be used due to being damaged. 
 - All floors were very dirty. There is a broom but no dustpan and brush to be able to sweep up the sand/dirt.
 - Although hand soap containers were in both bathrooms and kitchen, they were empty and we needed to buy soap for them. 
 - No dishwashing liquid was provided to be able to wash dishes. 
 - They do provide dishwasher tablets for the 1 drawer dishwasher. 
 - Not enough plates or cutlery for 10 adults.

We were very disappointed with the state of the property and felt that it was a long way from being value for money. We would not be able to recommend this property. It is way overpriced for how it presents presently.

Great location to the slopes and resort amenities. Spacious and accommodated everyone in our group. Host was very responsive and kind.

Be sure to bring toilet paper because there is a limited amount even though listing does not stipulate to bring more outside of 2 rolls per bathroom.

We cooked every meal but did not have any food storage options(Tupperware) for leftovers.

While this is a great location and very spacious, the king beds are very worn down and have big impressions in them which make it hard to get comfortable and sleep well.

When we arrived, there were past guest’s supplies left in the fridge, one tv had been damaged prior to our stay, lights out and flickering in fridge and microwave, and dishwasher did not really clean the dishes. There was a white film on all the dishes and they had to be washed prior to using.

Again, we had a wonderful time and it is a great location for a family ski trip, just a few considerations would have made it even better!

++ Internet schnell und relativ leicht einzurichten. Alle 5 Geräte konnten über WiFi verbunden werden und hatten gleichzeitig Zugang zum Internet.
++ Einchecken auch um 12:00 möglich. War positiv überrascht, wie schnell wir die Schlüssel bekommen haben.
++ In 10 Tagen 2 Mal Putzkolone.
+ Relativ nah an Strand. Man kann morgens mit den Surf-Nomaden hin und abends zurück
+ Beten sind stabil und sauber. Wir konnten ohne Rückenschmerzen gut schlafen.
+ Die große Elektrogeräte in der Küche sind relativ neu und funktionell
+ Es gibt tatsächlich 3 Schlafzimmer und keine der 6 Personen muss im Wohnzimmer auf dem Sofa schlafen. (Wie andere Inserate in diesem Region die Anzahl der Schlafplätze gerne übertrieben)
+ Das Haus ist Alarm gesichert.
o Der Tisch und die Stühle in der Küche sind viel neuer als die alte Einbauküchenelemente (IKEA machts möglich)
o Müllentsorgungskonzept relativ OK. Mann muss 100m zu Fuß zum Container (Glas, Plastik/Verpackung, Papier, Hausmüll)
o Küche ist mit Allem nötigen für 6 Personen ausgestattet
o Es gibt (wie im meisten Ferienhäuser) keine Garderobe im Flur oder in der Diele. Man hat aber reichlich Platz für Sofa und Sessel.
o Die Klopapierhalter sind magnetisch und schwergängig aber funktionieren. Bitte vorsichtig öffnen, weil jemand schon die Dübel aus der Wand gerissen hat.
- Die Kühlschranktür wurde mit Anschlag-Rechts montiert statt Links. Der Kühlschrank erlaubt eine Montage mir dem Türanschlag links und so wäre es auch viel einfacher gewesen etwas aus dem Kühlschrank zu holen und auf dem Tisch zu stellen.
- Tor funktioniert nicht. Man kann mit dem Auto nicht auf den Hof.
- Wanduhr in der Küche funktioniert nicht
- Der Wasserkocher leckt Wasser
- Lüfter im Badezimmer funktioniert nicht
- Insektenschutz gab einmal, jetzt ist an allen Fenstern kaputt.
- Die Fenster sind schwergängig und relativ verrostet.
-- Die Einbauküchenmöbel fehlt auseinander. Die Hängeschränke verlieren ihre Unterrahmen, die Laminierung der Fachböden und Seitenwände kommt ab, die Arbeitsplattenleiste hat sich von der Wand gelöst. 
--- Kakerlaken im Haus (~2cm groß). Nachdem ich unter der Eibauküchenschränke hinter Lippenleiste gründlich den jahrelangen Dreck geputzt habe und lebendige/tote Insekte entfernt habe, gab es keine weitere Begegnungen. Wir haben die Leiste, während unseres Aufenthalts nicht mehr angebracht damit sich keine Viecher sich einnisten können.

Place is disgusting and infested with German cockroaches. Checked in Sunday night and saw the first of many. Contacted the property manager and stated I needed pest control out there the next day. They said they would then said Tuesday. I was in town for business and moved all of my morning meetings to the afternoon to meet pest control between 8 and 12. Never showed, the last communication from manager was at 3:30pm asking me if pest control showed up. Dismissive of customer concerns which are legitimate concerns. Place did not have any smoke detectors, shares a water heater with the apartment upstairs so your shower is out of hot water in 5 mins. Will NEVER stay anywhere Silver Street Management is associated.

REVIEW: 
I always like to give good reviews but this time, it was just too much. Although the condo appeared clean, it was infested with roaches. We killed at least 10 and the last morning when we got up before the sun and turned on the lights they were everywhere!!! Running inside the toilet bowl, in the kitchen sink, dozens of them running across the floors, it made me sick just thinking about them being in our food, clothes and beds! Also the first night our toilet was slow, by morning it wouldn't flush. We called Vacasa as directed and someone came within a couple of hours but was unable to fix it, he came back around 5:30 on Friday night to pick up his stuff and said he couldn't fix it and a plumber would have to come. I asked when he would be here and he said "" I don't know, it's Friday night so I don't know if he will come tonight"". He did not return that night nor the remainder of the trip, we never heard from anyone and when I sent a text message as directed I got a generic response saying no one was available at this time. We spent the remainder of the trip all having to share one bathroom. I spent an outrageous amount of money for 3 nights at the condo as a Christmas gift to my mom and daughter so that we could enjoy a special time together only to be disgusted, embarrassed and frustrated by the entire vacation. We've stayed at many VRBO type places and always had excellent experiencs, this was extremely disappointing. I sent a message stating I would like to speak to someone about my concerns however, as of today I have yet to hear from anyone. I am not the type of person to complain and I can overlook alot of things including a couple of bugs, but this was over the top when there are dozens of bugs and a toilet that never worked. I hope someone will contact me soon.

nightmare
REVIEW: 
We booked a house on the beach with a heated pool and spa. When we got there everything seemed clean the house was nice and as advertised. Within an hour we saw a cockroach and another one came up the drain as I was brushing my teeth and they were big! I sent a message out to Vacasa who only would respond by text and klept saying we will reach out to our team and get back to you. Someone from the team the next day reached out via text and told us he saw a roach the day before we checked in but they were palmettos and they were outside bugs and non invasive. I understand Floridians call their roaches that. They were most definitely cockroaches and many of them. He said he would order an extra spray but couldn’t get anyone there until Tuesday and we checked in on Saturday due to a holiday weekend. Still no word on Tuesday after reaching out to them many times, buying our own roach traps and spray, containers for our food, many nights of no sleep, constantly killing and watching for roaches. Wednesday the exterminator showed up and told us that we had a bigger problem and there was a leak in the plumbing and that they were coming up the drains from the sewer. He told us what we needed to do and boil water and pour it down the drains amongst getting a plumber. Mind you this is our vacation rental and we informed him we are on vacation not our house. Later that night we got a text from the local crew that we needed to switch houses due to “the bigger issue” and we would get some level of compensation. We were moved to another house not on the beach, the pool wasn’t heated and the neighbors hated having vacationers in the neighborhood and had protest signs in their yards. Long story short we also paid for heated pool it wasn’t heated or clean and they told us to clean it. They said we would be reimbursed for the pool not being heated. We moved houses, no reimbursement for the no heated pool or the stay with the infested house of roaches. Overall we had a horrible vacation and no compensation for anything NEVER will go to another Vacasa home again. Horrible!

I have been to this location before and loved Puerta Del Mar In Aguadilla. I decided to travel with my 7yr old to bring in the new year with my family who reside in PR. 1- a three hour delay check in. 2- it was not clean (dirty microwave with rice crumbs, windows dirty, patio dirty, dust accumulation on bedroom furniture, floors dirty throughout especially in bedroom and bathrooms) roach infested , unsafe electrical outlet was unable to turn air conditioner on in bedroom for 24 hrs until it was repaired it was sparking. The television was unable to be heard unless you were sitting directly in front of it, if you hit the remote to turn off a bedroom light or ceiling fan it would also activate the same in the other bedroom . The owner/ manager was contacted since the first day of arrival and each day afterwards . I told him that they had left a roach spray on the kitchen counter and it was empty , he never cared enough to send another or address the infestation of roaches. My 7 yr old was upset each day afraid to enter the kitchen because of the roaches. I have video and photos of my complaint and expressed my disappointment to VRBO and the owner. I submitted 36 attachments it was a total of (17) complaints to VRBO of my evidence photos , videos and the texts between the owner and myself . I am still waiting on a response. The date of incident 12-28-22 thru 1-3-23. This place was a true nightmare, I was embarrassed to even have my family over, my daughter was traumatized. THIS IS NOT THE OASIS AS DEPICTED AND DEFINITELY NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN.

REVIEW: 
This is a very beautiful home in a nice area. However the owner is not very helpful. There's a $20 fee for resort pass that you must purchase in order to avoid waiting in line every time you enter the gate. This was not mentioned in the listing. We seen many roaches in the kitchen and bedrooms. We contacted the host for simple requests and concerns and never got a response throughout our entire 5 night stay. 

The owner provides the bare minimum. One soap, one toilet paper, 2 trash bags and a few towels. We had to purchase napkins, dish soap, trash bags, sponges to wash dishes, and more... 

This is a nice home but the host does not seem committed to maintaining this rental or making his guests happy.

Disappointing at best! Great unit, lovely ocean view, but not luxury. Certainly not worth the price.
While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and the Unit had no Wi-Fi !
Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote but NO Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager.

TITLE: 
great place
REVIEW: 
We loved our stay here. The place has everything you need for an extended stay. We stayed for three weeks and bought a vegetable steamer which we left at the property. Pics are accurate but we were told that the throw pillows were for staging only. Those are important to us for lumbar back support. The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues. That means it is mostly an issue with the router, not the modem or the internet connection to the property itself. Although, normal router was still good for YouTube or Netflix. The place was clean but I would say it needs a deep clean. Shower pan is one example. The bed is comfortable and linens are top notch. We did find baby cockroaches in the kitchen area and bathroom and bought the roach motel thing at the market. This is Hawaii and so, we weren’t surprised but also not great. Just keep your food containers sealed or in the refrigerator. Another con is the proximity to the pool and jacuzzi. Both can get loud at times. But noise cuts off if you close lanai door. Also, everyone is out of the pool area by 10 pm. The pro is that the unit is really super close to the pool and jacuzzi and we enjoyed them quite a bit. All in all, we would come back.

REVIEW: 
Property not cleaned when we arrived, dirty linen strewn over floors, dirty floors, dirty table surfaces, dirty bathrooms with toilet bowls containing excrement. Owner was reportedly occupying property prior to us, left it in a mess. We finally got into the property around 9 pm after dinner (check-in time was 4pm), and the agent did agree to reimburse dinner. After cleaning was performed by a team called in by the agent, there were other issues. One bathroom was missed in the cleaning (my daughter had to clean the shower, floor, and excrement coated toilet bowl). There was a cockroach infestation (in kitchen drawers, dishwasher, bedrooms - we had to purchase surface spray and treat both inside and outside the house, plus go through and clean kitchen drawer contents). Three bathrooms needed tap repairs (taps broken and nonfunctional, and plumber attended the following day after we repeatedly requested same). Freezer was filthy with dried meat blood. In the front yard, there was dog faeces located in various places on the grass, as well as prawn shells in a few locations. Compensation of less than 10% of the total cost (including the dinner reimbursement) was paid, which I consider to be totally inadequate given the property was advertised as a luxury property with an expensive nightly rate. The first response from the local agent when we finally managed to get her to attend the property, was “I’ve seen worse”. Not exactly what you want to hear when you’re expecting a luxury getaway.
This is a real shame as the property is in an excellent location but has been let run down.
Quality control by the local agent leaves much to be desired.
Photos of the condition of the property when we arrived are available if needed.

nightmare vacation, worse airbnb - roach infested, unsafe and dirty
REVIEW: 
I have been to this location before and loved Puerta Del Mar In Aguadilla. I decided to travel with my 7yr old to bring in the new year with my family who reside in PR. 1- a three hour delay check in. 2- it was not clean (dirty microwave with rice crumbs, windows dirty, patio dirty, dust accumulation on bedroom furniture, floors dirty throughout especially in bedroom and bathrooms) roach infested , unsafe electrical outlet was unable to turn air conditioner on in bedroom for 24 hrs until it was repaired it was sparking. The television was unable to be heard unless you were sitting directly in front of it, if you hit the remote to turn off a bedroom light or ceiling fan it would also activate the same in the other bedroom . The owner/ manager was contacted since the first day of arrival and each day afterwards . I told him that they had left a roach spray on the kitchen counter and it was empty , he never cared enough to send another or address the infestation of roaches. My 7 yr old was upset each day afraid to enter the kitchen because of the roaches. I have video and photos of my complaint and expressed my disappointment to VBRO and the owner. I submitted 36 attachments it was a total of (17) complaints to VBRO of my evidence photos , videos and the texts between the owner and myself . I am still waiting on a response. The date of incident 12-28-22 thru 1-3-23. This place was a true nightmare, I was embarrassed to even have my family over, my daughter was traumatized. THIS IS NOT THE OASIS AS DEPICTED AND DEFINITELY NOT A PLACE FOR CHILDREN.

REVIEW: 
Daytona Beach Shores is a wonderful and central location to enjoy a lot of Florida attractions. From this spot, we took in St. Augestine, NASA, New Smyrna, Ponce De Leon Lighthouse and beach, the State Parks north of Ormond, etc, etc. Also close enough to do theme parks if that's your jam. The condo unit was clean, well-maintained, and well-appointed. 

Downside was that after the hurricane, almost every Daytona Beach condo had damage to their pool decks and pools. So there was no pool at the condo, and the beach was fenced off the entire time we were there. You had to sneak around fences and gates to access the beach. High tide also made most of the beach unaccessable for several hours. During the day, there was a lot of construction on the beach. It is what it is, but I had no idea the damage was so extensive that far North. This is more an FYI for others who may ve considering this spot for vacation.

REVIEW: 
We booked this condo before hurricane Ian caused so much damage to the Gulf Coast. Anne Marie was fantastic in communicating the condition and repairs on and around the condo area and because of her we kept our reservation. This condo has so many things going for it. The furnishings are all perfect - clean and in great shape - no wear or stains. The mattress is amazingly comfortable and the sheets are quality! The dishwasher is by far the quietest that we have ever encountered in a rental. The screened in deck showcased fantastic sunrises and had the advantage of shade in the late afternoon. The kitchen was well appointed with nice cookware, dishes and a nice variety of basic spices and coffee. There is not a washer/dryer in the unit but it is a short distance from the condo to the coin machines on the very same floor and detergent is furnished for a load or two. The rainfall shower is wonderful and spacious and there were plenty of amenities for soap/shampoo/conditioners and plenty of clean towels. We did not go to the beach, but there is a great supply of beach items if you choose to go. We did run into a bit of updating that had been delayed due to the hurricane, but it was nothing that the owners had control of and they were so very helpful as we worked our way though that. We had a wonderful and warm week - thank you!

sewage smell on property overwhelmed the beautiful location
REVIEW: 
Pat's at Punaluu is located on a beautiful stretch of beach, perfect for snorkeling. Unfortunately the ongoing construction, which we were told ahead of our stay would be only a minor disturbance. In fact we found out that the sewage treatment is under repair. When we pulled up to the property for our stay a sewage truck was blocking the parking lot, emptying the sewer lines for the building. The second night, in the middle of the night the stench of sewer gas was so strong in our room that our eyes were watering and our infant began coughing. We had to move onto the sofa near the balcony to sleep. Ultimately do you safety concerns, we had to evacuate the property the next morning, cutting short our week long stay by 5 nights and having to find a hotel at the last minute. We called the property manager to inquire about the overpowering sewer gas smell, and he readily acknowledged that the sewage treatment on the property was broken and was an ongoing issue. We believe that the property should not be rented out to other unsuspecting families until the construction of the sewage handling is completed.

REVIEW: 
We (a family group of 5) had a wonderful time at this beachfront condo in New Smyrna Beach. The sounds of the waves, long walks on the beach, and cool breezes were a perfect break between two theme park visits. The interior is just as the photos depict and the kitchen is well-stocked with tea & coffee and the leftovers from previous visitors (don't buy olive oil -- there are at least 3 bottles). 

Hurricane damage washed out the condo's direct access to the water (and the pool is out of order too, not a problem in January) but the beach is accessible via a staircase just a five minute walk away (on 10th).

The host (Beverly Trent) was very responsive to all my questions (first time VRBO). I highly recommend the condo and, if I lived in the region, would stay again.

gas leaks through out the property that were not fixed
REVIEW: 
We stayed in this rental January 20-23. We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

The property has a great open water view and the property is well maintained and very well stocked with towells, tp, etc. The 3rd bedroom on the lower is a bit small so each floor is best suited for 2. It will accommodate 6 however. There were some nice beach chairs and flotation devices supplied in the shed across the street by the canal which was handy. Easy check in and out. The grill connection to the propane bottle has a gas leak but otherwise everything worked very well. There is a nice patio on the ground floor which i understand well be becoming a swimming pool soon, but the best view is from the wrapm around deck upstairs. wished it had better tv channel selection, but if you can bring you access from your tv at home, you can use Hulu, netflix, sling, etc. Overall we had a great time and would recommend this host and the property.

worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

REVIEW: 
This was my first time at this house and my family and friends have had a nightmare stay. Our whole house was filled with carbon monoxide because of the house's cheap piping and faulty carbon monoxide detectors. When the ambulance arrived because all of our kids were throwing up. They quickly opened the doors to the house and let the house air out. Then they proceeded to check everyone for carbon monoxide poisoning and 16 of the 19 people tested positive for carbon monoxide. We initially thought this poisoning happened at the hot springs we were at and we didn't say much to Ron. Then the carbon monoxide ""experts"" came and checked the house when it completely aired out. I talked with someone in the ambulance when they were giving the kids oxygen and they said this wasn't the first time the ""big house on the corner"" filled up with carbon monoxide. The next day we received our paper work and one of the kids got ""food poisoning"" which was very weird since everyone that was helping us said we had carbon monoxide poisoning. When we were leaving the house, I got a text from Ron about some missing remote and that I should keep a habit of putting it in place. I said to him ""I haven't even seen a remote downstairs and he shouldn't talk like that to me after what happened"" and his response was ""I will counter it with the food poisoning paperwork"" that he found in the trash. Today I recieved an $800 fine for ripped couch, railing damage, remote control lost etc. What an evil person!!!!

great location -- not a comfortable stay
REVIEW: 
I'll start with the positive: the house is a great location. We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak! 

The net is I would not stay here again.

REVIEW: 
The trip started off just fine. Finding the dingy was not to hard. We got the motor fired up, loaded up the dingy & took the first load out to the boat. That took a little time to find but once you find it it was pretty easy. On our way back to shore the motor died, out of gas. Luckily it died at shore. We texted Isidora. She respond quickly & came out filled up the dingy with gas & we were on our way. Though this time the motor was not responding like it was when we first arrived. The main reason that we decided to stay on the boat was because she offered dingy & two kayaks that we could explore the mangroves with. But the motors not working correctly. Besides that the first night wasn't bad. The next day we get up & head into town to get some fishing gear & breakfast. That morning the motor was a pain to start. So I text her to try & get the motor fixed or to have the spare motor put on the dingy. She said her mechanic will be there around 12 or 1 to fix it. So we spend the morning buying fishing gear, having breakfast & exploring Key Largo. At 2, I reach out to her & she says that it should be good to go. We get back to the dingy it starts right up & we start taking off. To only have the motor die half way out to the boat. By this point we are stating to get annoyed with everything. So we limp it back to the boat. Once again I contact her & say that dingy is not working. She then says she will get her mechanic & will bring the other motor out & swap them. Perfect right, nope. By now its 2:45pm. She said she would just meet us at the boat with the mechanic to fix it. At 4pm she says that her mechanic is no where to be found so she needed us to limp the dingy back to shore, so we do. With no mechanic in sight we had to swap out the motor. Which normally we would not have a problem with that. But after today we are just over it. We get covered in gas/oil from the leaky motor. My buddy hurt his back from carrying the motor back to the car for her. So now it's our last day, we just spend the whole day messing around with the motor. Bought all of this fishing gear & its now 5pm & we just got back on the water. Also mosquitoes ate us ALIVE. She said that she would refund us for our troubles. We thought that was a very nice gesture. Since we left I have text her multiple times inquiring about the refund & no responses. She leaves my ""texts"" on read but thats it. Do not waste your time with this VRBO. You are better off picking a different host.

rental is very misleading and very poorly kept/managed
REVIEW: 
Summary: Overall a very poor experience. Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!

winter getaway
REVIEW: 
For the 10th year my family and friends convened in Estes Park for a weekend of concerts and the lodge was an absolutely amazing home away from home for us. 
Everyone enjoyed their rooms, the great showers/bathrooms and the wonderful kitchen area (I may be stealing some ideas from that awesome island for my kitchen rebuild soon)
There was a huge consensus about the desire to return to the house for future trips.

There was an issue with a smell in the downstairs kitchen/bunkbed area the first morning. I called the property manager a couple times and left messages about it before we figured out it was tied to hot water use. When my call was returned the evening of the next day I was informed that it was a normal occurrence when the property has been vacant for a bit of time related to water system drainage. By that time the smell had stopped occurring and our initial concerns that it was a small gas leak were alleviated.

REVIEW: 
The morning before we left for Fredericksburg we were notified that the property we had selected was not available due to a gas leak. We were given 2 choices as a replacement. We did not like the choices but took the Cabin on Hackberry instead of the other place because of stairs at the other place. We think we should have been given the opportunity to reschedule at our original choice at another date. We left a day early due to the weather and the location and the layout of the replacement property. We think you should give us a credit for use at the property we wanted at another time.

Augen auf bei der Reisebuchung: Nach zwei Corona-Jahren haben wir für die Sommerferien 2022 über FeWo-direkt.de ein tolles Ferienhaus mit eigenem Pool im oberen Preissegment (230 €/Tag) in Kroatien gebucht.

Schon nach der ersten Nacht im Haus kamen unsere beiden Kinder (9 und 5 Jahre) am Morgen mit jeweils gut 100 Stichen an Armen, Beinen und im Gesicht aus ihrem Zimmer. Sie sahen einfach nur schlimm aus! Wir hielten es zunächst für Mückenstiche, doch aufgrund der heftigen Attacke, des quälenden Juckreizes und nach weiteren Recherchen waren wir sicher, dass wir ein Problem mit Bettwanzen hatten. Ein Arzt bestätigte unseren Verdacht. 

Wir haben sofort unsere Vermieter vor Ort informiert und auch versucht, Belvilla zu kontaktieren, doch weder unter der benannten Telefonnummer noch per E-Mail war eine Kontaktaufnahme möglich. Auch EuroTours als genannte Agentur vor Ort war völlig uninteressiert und untätig.

Unser Ziel war es nun, so schnell wie möglich abzureisen - allerdings auch, den Import der Parasiten um jeden Preis zu verhindern! ALLES wurde gewaschen, in der Sonne getrocknet und in schwarzen Säcken wärmebehandelt - unser gesamtes Hab und Gut. Drei Tage haben wir in einer Notunterkunft geschlafen, die unser Vermieter vor Ort organisiert hat, und jeweils am Tag den Rückbau bewerkstelligt. Es war ein Albtraum!

Mit dem Kammerjäger haben wir uns am Tag der Abreise ‚die Klinke in die Hand gegeben‘. Völlig fertig haben wir unsere Rückreise angetreten - 1.400 km non stopp. Denn unsere Nachfolge-Unterkunft in Österreich, wo wir noch 4 Tage verbringen wollten, mussten wir auch stornieren.

Eine Recherche hat schnell gezeigt, dass es offensichtlich Strategie ist, nicht erreichbar zu sein. Über den Facebook Messenger (!) haben wir den Mangel angezeigt, dann erst hat Belvilla reagiert. Man sollte meinen, dass Belvilla einen sofortigen Handlungsbedarf sieht, um den Schaden zu regulieren, aber weit gefehlt! Hinhalten heißt die Strategie. Nach langem, zähen Hin und Her hat Belvilla ein ‚Kulanzangebot’ unterbreitet, das nicht mal dem Tagessatz einer Übernachtung entspricht. Alles mit der Begründung, dass wir nicht den sofortigen Kontakt gesucht hätten. 
Das entspricht schlicht nicht den Tatsachen und ist einfach erbärmlich. 
Achtung: Belvilla ist höchst unseriös, nie wieder! Ohne Anwalt kommt man hier nicht weiter. 
Wir fragen uns - bei all den schlechten Bewertungen - warum dieses Unternehmen überhaupt noch Partner auf Portalen ist.

beware!! overwhelming mold scent - blood stained bedding
REVIEW: 
As soon as I opened the door I was great with an overwhelming musty mold order that permiated through every room of the home. A few of the beds had bedding with multiple stains on both sides. The worse stain appeared to be blood. There were cobwebs in the corners of the room. One of the kids woke up with what appeared to be a spider bite. There was a thick build up of dust on the ceiling fans. The air filter was dirty. The pool table was gross. The ping pong table, net, and one of the paddles were broke. One of the closet doors were off sitting inside closet. Some of the tv's did not have remotes. This booking was beyond a dissapointment. Worse experience to date. I have several pics to share.

REVIEW: 
There’s a bed bug infestation. Stayed 2 nights. The first morning I had a few welts which I wanted to believe were mosquito bites but it’s January; mosquitoes are dead. Never saw a single mosquito. Second and final morning the welts were all over my torso and sides. I supplied the owner with photos of the numerous bites I experienced and she said she’d have an exterminator inspect the place for bed bugs and get back to me. Now she has stopped communicating. If you’re still reading….unfortunately the other reviews are accurate. Many windows are lacking blinds including the French doors in the kitchen and the entire game room which cannot be closed off bc there’s no door. The blinds in the master bedroom, master bath and living room are broken in a way that anyone can see in. Basically the entire house can be seen from the outside from multiple vantage points. The neighborhood is very sketchy. After dark the entire back doors (glass) are completely exposed to the back yard and neighbors and anyone who wants to see inside. Only the back door keypad was working until it malfunctioned late at night and I found myself locked out trouble shooting via text with the owner. She refuses to have actual conversations. The other reviews are correct: roach motels and roach bait in all cabinets and drawers. Had to wash all dishes prior to using them and after since you have to start the dishwasher, strip linens and take out the trash prior to leaving. Not sure what the high cleaning fee is for if you’re the one cleaning. The hot tub water was cloudy and the jets barely worked on one side. This is a tired, dirty, bed bug infested property in a bad neighborhood. Do not under any circumstances book this place.

okay for price
REVIEW: 
For only $80 per night it was an ok stay. On the day of check-in I didn’t get any information from the host. 2hr before arrival I had to message the host and ask which apt was ours and how to get in. We weren’t given an apt number so we mistakenly tried to open two other doors before we found ours. Walking into the apt there was a strange smell and the bathroom smelled worse, like dirty pipes and poor ventilation for moisture. The shower wand needs to be changed, it’s so caked up with mineral buildup and mold that the stream that you get from it, is basically drops. The linoleum tiles in the bathroom are lifting because of the moisture and there was mold in the shower. And the water control didn’t really work, we had to play around with it to get a comfortable temperature otherwise the water would constantly go back and forth from very cold to scalding. The sheets on the bed weren’t clean, we found hair and just other debris and my sister would find red dots on herself the next couple days. There weren’t bed bugs so I’m assuming it was just a reaction to the sheets being dirty, but we did find ants in the apt.

beautiful property with some negative quirks
REVIEW: 
Overall I liked staying at this property - the loft makes it feel like you’re in a fancy treehouse inside of a house and it’s absolutely beautiful, the hot tub was lovely, and there were plenty of bathrooms and bedrooms. However, I think the hot tub was dirty or there were bed bugs or something on the property because I came back from my trip there with itchy red bumps all over my stomach; the host started us off with 4 trash bags total for a group of 11 people for an entire weekend and had no extras so we had to purchase them ourselves; each bathroom only had max half a roll of toilet paper and there was no other toilet paper in the house so we had to purchase more ourselves; the cleaning instructions at check out were fairly intensive but we still had to pay a cleaning fee and I personally feel it’s one or the other. I think it wouldn’t have cost the hosts that much to have provided trash bags and toilet paper so we didn’t have to go out of our way to purchase them. It’s a small thing but it does affect how people view the house when you refuse to provide basic necessities that will last long enough for a large group. Also the trash can and dishwasher are pretty small for the size of the house and amount of guests that can stay there.

REVIEW: 
The Aspens are fine. Do not stay in A1A or use Jackson Hole Real Estate Company whatever you do. We found bed bugs, lost a day of skiing, had to move mid week to a home ( a very gracious man lent us no charge) spent forever cleaning all of our clothes, not once but again when we returned home. Had to disinfect all of our luggage since it can't be washed, and you're still not sure if you're not bring the bed bugs back home. It was a disaster, no hotel or other rental would take us because we were coming from an infested location. And they decided to give us 1 night refund for a totally ruined ski vacation after promising $3000 refund when this was all going on. Too bad there isn't a zero star category.

REVIEW: 
Loved the house and location. We loved that we could sit outside and watch wildlife on the canal. Beautiful view. Unfortunately, the outside furniture was extremely dirty and moldy. We had to put a sheet over the cushion on the loveseat. The table had to be washed too. The deck was not safe and needed to be replaced. Fenced yard was great for the dog. 
We loved the house. It was roomy and comfortable. 
Inside was clean for the most part but I accidentally stuck my hand in grease left on the stove. Rug in master bed room has a corner the sticking up and is a trip hazard. Complain about it the 1st day and reminded them several times by text and email but it was 2 weeks before it was taped down. 
The neighborhood was good. Well maintained. House located on a court so no traffic. There was a unlicensed broken down car right next to the driveway that made it more difficult to back out of it. We were excited to have a garage but couldn’t use it due to the fact that it was full of stuff. It shouldn’t even be mentioned in the listing if you can’t park in it. 
We were there 3 weeks. We paid for a month but the day before we were leaving, my brother pasted away so we totally lost a whole week’s rent. Vrbo does not take into consideration the loss of an immediate family member.

The lights in the house are hard to figure out, and the fading magic marker scrawlings on the faceplates add no charm. The lower level storage space is messy, and we found a “surprise” in one of the drawers upstairs. A little more attention to detail and this will be a fantastic property.

REVIEW: 
· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

The lock box for the property key was corroded up, also some sliding doors wouldn't slide or would fall of their rails.
The property is also like two separate residences as it's not very interconnected.
Finally was advertised as both a 6 bedroom and a 4 bedroom by Stayz which was very confusing 😕.

Location is great if you're visiting Universal Studios as it's only 10 min away. Hosts provided everything you would need and the place is very nice. Slider was broken when we went (hosts left a message apologizing for inconvenience on slider) so couldn't use the balcony, but it was raining while we were there so that wasn't an issue for us. Parking is basically street parking (just off street, but no gate or anything) so I was a bit concerned about break-ins, but nothing happened while we were there so my concern was for naught. Do pay attention to the ""two flights of stairs"" in the listing though as that was the only part that I wish I had put more thought in to :-). Overall, I would gladly stay here again.

Check in process was a bit confusing at first, lucky I travel for work a lot and was able to figure out the elevator/door codes and where to go. The parking garage was confusing at first but were able to figure that all out. It was very difficult to exit the garage at night due to the valet from a restaurant blocking most the exit. 

But that elevator.. We would enter the code and would start moving to our floor then the door would not open and would send us back down to whichever floor had just hit the elevator button. It happened three separate times to the point we stopped using the elevator for fear it would trap us in. 

I have been to Nashville for many weekend trips and will keep this location in mind for the next trip.

REVIEW: 
I appreciate reviews, take them into consideration, and therefore feel I should also provide them for others. This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.
A couple of hours later, she and another gal showed up with a new tv. They did not know how to hook it up and called a third gal from the office who came over when she could get away. She got the new tv working. I did not ask for any refund but I did ask the manager during that time if THEY offered any rebates to partially compensate for a trip as full of annoyances as this one. I just made the point that I had spent over $6000 to fly to Marco to rest and the 8 days had been anything but restful. She replied that none of this was anyone’s fault and she’d have to ask the owner about any rebate. I said thank you, please do that. As she left my unit, I reiterated, please let me know what the owner says and she said she would. I never heard another word from her.
She did also tell me that they couldn’t haul the old tv off and she would leave it and the box trash on our front porch for someone to come get. When we left 5 days later, all that trash was still setting there.

During the next 5 days, I was briefly stuck on the small elevator that goes to the upper private parking level. No call button on that elevator worked. We parked our car on the lower level and used the main elevator or the stairs. On the last day, packing to leave, we had suitcases and boxes and bags to ferry from the 4th floor to the first floor parking garage. This time my friend got stuck on the main elevator which then quit working completely. He escaped and called the Esplanade management company number posted on the elevator. That guy sounded unconcerned, yeah, we’ve been having some elevator trouble, I’ll call Otis again, blah, blah, blah. Don’t you think you should put a sign on the elevator so people will know, we asked. Oh, I’ll just cut off the circuit breaker when I get a chance to get over there, he said. (Sure hope no one was on it.) And we’re not kids but we could climb up and down 8 flights of stairs; everyone may not be able to do that.

Summary: Did we enjoy our visit? Yes of course because we don’t let stuff steal our joy and I do think our unit property folks tried at times and I also know stuff happens. But I’ve stayed at Esplanade twice before in two different units in the past few years. I loved the first two visits and can recall only experiencing one issue which was resolved satisfactorily in 10 minutes. The property is still beautiful, the restaurants are great, and the view is just stunning.
But I spent way too much money and time this trip to be wrangling problems I can face at home for free.

a new way of luxury!
REVIEW: 
30A-Vacations was outstanding! The property is amazing and it was truly a pleasure being able to enjoy the property and 30A-Vacations outstanding service. When I originally booked the place it had a lot of availability, I imagined because it’s new. Agreeing seeing everything, I know that’s the case! I’ve got no doubt that this’ll be one that fills up quickly in the future! My family and I will be on it! Three things to note:

1) If you get stuck between floors in the elevator outside of business hours, try all possible fix actions first. Then call the fire department. That emergency number that’s given to you is not a 24 hour emergency line.

2) If you want hot tub / pool heating access during your stay, communicate that ahead of time.(At least 3 days) I missed that memo and in turn missed out on the hot fun. :(

3) Have a blast!

Thanks again 30A

We’ll see you soon!

TITLE: 
disappointed
REVIEW: 
I rented this condo for a family weekend getaway. The proximity to the main strip in Gatlinburg is great. The building, though, is run down. One main reason I booked this room was because it had an indoor pool for my kids, but the pool was closed. However, there were about 10 young adults/teens partying in the pool area around 10 pm...drinking & smoking pot, which could be smelled in the room. The elevator didn't work properly...my husband & son were stuck when trying to check out with our luggage on a luggage cart. The bathtubs looked dingy & every sink/tub seemed clogged (wouldn't properly drain). The beds were rock hard. The tvs were a pain to try & figure out (multiple remotes, some without batteries) & no instructions. I was leery of using the towels because they didn't smell clean/looked dingy. There was accumulated dust on fixtures feom the ceiling. The parking area is very small & the spaces are too narrow. My son has special needs & we have a hanicapped tag for him...there were yound adults outside messing around & parked in a handicapped spot without a handicapped placard or tag. With no office or officials there, we had no way to have any of our issues handled. All in all, it was truly an awful experience & this place is not for people seeking a nice family trip.

The cabin is in a great location, right next to the zoo. It also has a great backyard. 

BUT the cabin has 2 showers and when we arrived we got a message that one of them doesn’t work. We were 11 people! 

To make things worse, the downstairs bath and shower that worked had unreliable water temperature. We were giving our 2 year old a bath and all of a sudden the water got scalding hot and burned him. When I contacted for service I was told there is nothing they can do about it. 

I would recommend this place if the showers functioned properly.

TITLE: 
bien situé mais trop cher et besoin de travaux
REVIEW: 
Nous avons loué cette propriété pour trois semaines avec nos trois enfants de 10 mois à 5 ans. Commençons par le positif: la localisation est idéale pour visiter le Sud de l’île mais également le centre, voire le Nord si on n’a pas peur de faire un peu de route. La maison est relativement spacieuse et le voisinage tranquille (quand les chiens des voisins ne jappent pas). Cuisine quand même bien équipée mais pourrait être mieux. Par contre, il y a plusieurs importants points négatifs à mentionner. Tout d’abord, le système de plomberie est déficient ou mériterait un entretien sérieux. De fortes odeurs nauséabondes d’urine et d’excréments ont embaumé notre séjour pendant plusieurs jours. La table de la salle à manger est brisée (bois en surface pourri et endommagé) et doit être remplacée. Les matériaux (surfaces, planchers, moulures, etc.) sont endommagés à plusieurs endroits: salle d’eau, salle de bain, cuisine et chambres. Les matelas sont très durs et inconfortables. Autres points à améliorer: le drain de douche est bouché, le moustiquaire de la chambre à l’étage ne ferme pas bien, la terrasse est très endommagée, des têtes de vis sortent du bois à plusieurs endroits (très dangereux pour s’y prendre les pieds). Enfin, les communications avec l’hôte en cours de séjours ont été ardues. La gestionnaire de la propriété ne répond pas aux mails le weekend et il nous a fallu deux suivis pour qu’une action soit entreprise en lien avec le problème d’odeurs émanant de la plomberie. La ville a coupé l’eau deux soirs de suite sans que nous ayons été avisés par l’hôte, nous privant de prendre des bains et douches (y compris les enfants), ce qui était inacceptable dans les circonstances. Des avis semblaient pourtant avoir été déposés dans la boîte postale mais n’ont pas été ramassés par la gestionnaire, nous empêchant ainsi d’en être informés à l’avance et prendre des dispositions appropriées. Aussi, elle est entré dans la maison en cours de séjour alors que nous n’y étions pas, sans nous aviser au préalable. Nous trouvions important de mentionner ces divers problèmes ici car pour le prix payé (300+ euros la nuit), nous nous attentions à mieux, autant de la propriété comme telle que de l’hôte, que nous avons trouvé peu professionnelle. Heureusement, les points positifs mentionnés ci-dessus ont rendu notre expérience agréable dans son ensemble.

little bungalow in a great location
REVIEW: 
We had a wonderful time staying in this little bungalow. The location is fantastic with easy access to the Balboa ferry station to go to Balboa and Catalina island. A couple things of note: the parking can be tricky. You have to park on the street and depending on the time of day, the spots may be full and you’ll need to park in the paid lots. Also, this is a very old house with only one heater in the main living space, so the bedroom can get quite cold if the door is closed during the night. And the water temp in the shower can fluctuate during your shower, so be careful so you don’t get scalded. Otherwise, this house had everything we needed for our stay and for the price in this area it was a good value.

REVIEW: 
Check in time was not correct.
Cleaners arrived after us and was there an hour after the updated check in time.
Getting the correct address was challenging and when we did get the address it was 49 minutes away from the pin drop on this app. Luckily there was regular local buses. But it added extra cost and time. We picked this place based on its location so was disappointed. There is very little beach most of the time none at all due to the sea, the steps leading down to the water is unsafe as its cracked on both sides so you are unable to go into the water from this access point.
The whole place smells of damp we had to keep the aircon on to stop the bedrooms from smelling. Leaving cupboard doors open. 
The cleaners put damp smelling sheets on the beds and we were left with dirty towels.
The kitchen cupboards also smell and apart from the microwave/coffee maker/cooker all other appliances listed are there but all have stickers on them stating they do not work.
Kitchen equipment is old and mix match. No scissors etc.
My friend got an electric shock from the smallest bedroom. The bigger room the plugs would spark now and again same for the plug by the kitchen bar.
One bathroom completely unusable (toilet, shower and sink) the main bedroom shower would not drain properly.
Pool was nice the block is rented out by mostly retired Canadians. Burger boys across the road... amazing food oxxo close by so not all bad!

REVIEW: 
My wife and I checked into this property expecting a relaxing weekend. In particular we were excited to use enjoy the sauna and spa bath as a way to get some winter relaxation. At first glance the property was OK - decently clean, but without any basic amenities like toiler paper, hand towels, linens, or any thing at all supplied. The kitchen supplies where all damage garbage. Worst of all, the sauna and tub, though they looked beautiful, where not in good working order. Both only worked for the first 12 hours of our stay, before an electrical short caused them to both stop working. Even before then, the sauna was of terrible quality with absolutely no insulation, leaking cold air so bad you could feel your feet getting cold even with the sauna at the maximum heat. The pool also did not get hot at all and was restricted to a maximum of 39.5c, luke warm at best. Even still, we could have enjoyed them, but after the short, the property manager sent out a repairmen who claimed we were lucky to not have been electrocuted by the short and that we would not be able to use the facilities for the rest of our 3 night stay. We were so disappointed we decided to just pack up and leave early, as this poorly lit and managed property, which terribly dim, cold, and boring, was not worth staying in without these amenities. Anyone booking this place should know it is being managed by a Danish corporation without any personal feeling whatsoever and is nothing more than a shoddy, dangerous tourist trap looking to take your money. We would never stay at this property again and will avoid ANY property run by novasol.

TITLE: 
good house, but need a renovation!
REVIEW: 
The house itself is not bad the location is good and nice close to the Disney parks (10 minutes) but it is far from Orlando (International Drive Premium Outlet is 40 minutes)
 Positive point: it has three complete bathrooms with shower.
 There's a Walmart next door, you can walk there, it's about a 10 minute walk.
 Very quiet village even during Christmas and New Year.
 Negative point: the master bedroom is small, the closets in all rooms are small.
 Point to consider: one of the single rooms is downstairs, if you have small children it might be a little tricky. 
We had a problem with the internet, there was no Wi-Fi for 9 days, I had to spend money on new SIM cards for the family's cell phones. The problem was with Spectrum's equipment, Shelly provided the repair.
The refrigerator leaks water internally and ends up wetting food, I had to put a container for the water inside the refrigerator.
At the village gate sometimes (almost every day) you get an electric shock (mild) on the keyboard.
 I would stay again if the price was a little lower.

A Good Value, but there are some issues - 

1. 6'x1.5"" gap in the blinds for the living room. No privacy.
2. The kitchen countertops are stained wood and the owner warns you about leaving water stains on the improperly finished kitchen countertops that can not get wet for more than a few minutes. Why not properly clear seal the wood countertops or apply a proper coating that can take moisture? 
3. The duplex receptacle near the kitchen sink is not a GFIC duplex receptacle as required by law and one receptacle is burnt out. Who wants to be electrocuted?

REVIEW: 
When we arrived Jan 20,2023 the house was extremely cold! It took 2 full days before it felt warm, the owner asks that the heat be turned off at night and once the house warmed up we were able to do that easily, the house would warm back up very quickly.

We did find that many items in the house are overdue for replacement. The bath towels were so thin, the coffee & cream containers were rusted inside, we only had 1 dish rag and dish towel, the fitted sheets elastic was basically gone.
If you go here with the understanding that you need to bring some basic things like bath towels, wash rag or sponge for the the bath and some essentials for the kitchen like extra dish rags, towels, coffee press, paper towels.

The area was wonderful, the only issue is a neighbor on the hill with a Great Dane that he brings down the hill to poop everyday and never cleans it up, it is EVERYWERE!!!

The Cliff walk is amazing, you can walk into town to grab a pint or bite after your cliff walk there and then walk back to the cottage. The beach down the slip is private and relaxing, we took a dip in the sea a couple mornings, so invigorating.

The owner Lina is wonderful and quick to respond to any messages, We would love to come back to this area in the future.

TITLE: 
relaxing stay on brewers bay
REVIEW: 
Brewers Bay Beach House is a perfect location for those looking for peace and quiet in a Caribbean Tropical setting. Nestled right on a secluded beach, you may not see another human being during your stay... which is exactly what the doctor ordered for those like us wishing to escape the hustle and bustle of city/suburban life for a little R&R. 

Brewers Bay is one of the least crowded bays on Tortola, and it is beautiful. As the pictures show accurately, it is right on the water... lots of toys and a nice reef to snorkel, right in front of the house. 

Things to do... 
- we rented a Suzuki Jimney - you WILL need this to access the property as the roads are sketch... we picked it up right at the ferry dock upon our arrival (Island Time Car Rentals)
- drive to the West End Ferry Dock and catch a 15 min ferry to Jost Van Dyke for 4 hours... rent a Jimney there and take the ""road less travelled"" over the top of the mountains (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!)... see the ""bubbly pool"" (don't forget your bathing suit)... on Beautiful White Bay take 5 mins to get a Painkiller at the Soggy Dollar (where it was invented) and then leave immediately and go next door to eat at Hendos (a much nicer establishment with better food)
- We ate at all the best restaurants on the Island... Best of the Best: Marche at Trellis on Beef Island - incredible Poke Bowl and Sushi Rolls! Sugar Mill Hotel - setting to die for. Dragon Fly Lounge for Lunch. French Deli for coffee / pastries / wine / rum / baguette sandwiches. Brandywine Estate - what a view!
- Drive to Beef Island and take the 20 min ferry ride one day to Virgin Gorda and the Baths... suggest eating at Marche at Trellis at 1130 - right by the ferry dock - take the 100pm to Virgin Gorda... $99 car deal gets you 2 round trip ferry tickets and a rental car for the day... 130 arrival and hit the Baths... then head to Little Dix Bay around 430 (Rosewood Resort) and rinse off in their outdoor beach shower, change into a sundress and polo with light slacks and loafers (no sandals allowed!) have a drink at the RUM Bar, and dine at 6PM at the Reef Restaurant at the resort... then take the 8PM (5 mins away) ferry back to Tortola. Little Dix Bay resort is amazing and worth a visit - grab a bike at the visitor's parking lot!
- Rent a boat (with or without a skipper) at Island Time an take the 20 min ride to The Indians for the best snorkeling in the VBI

A wonderful VACAY in a magical place!

REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use Airbnb all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

REVIEW: 
This is hands down the dirtiest vacation rental I have ever stayed in. I don’t even know where to start. How about the sheets on the bed had dried blood/mucus on them? Dried blood was also smeared on the wall of the downstairs bathroom. There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but it wasn’t. Maybe I’m gonna be a hotel person from now on.

We arrived late at night to check in with our kids who already fell asleep on the drive there. After we opened the doors to this unit, the smell of ammonia slapped us in the face. There were air fresheners everywhere but they only seemed to make the odor worse. We then realized the ammonia odor was from rat urine. We found rat droppings and rat traps in the kitchen. The rat traps were hidden under the sink, but the rat droppings were not hidden at all. We had to leave the unit immediately. The owner texted me that he would issue a full refund, but never did. No one should EVER have to go through what our family went through with Golan, owner of Saba Housing.

Single use amenities only, no pantry staples (oil, spices, condiments, basic flour/sugar) no coffee pods for the Kurig the only way to make coffee unless you bring your own appliance and beans. Bring everything. We located wood for the fire behind the garage as we were only given 2 logs and 8 pieces of kindling, upon asking the property manager, we were informed we should go purchase some (from where?!). The home was not very clean at arrival, including the front walk covered in snow and ice, dirty foyer, mouse droppings in drawers, living room rug full of crumbs. We found a vacuum to use, and it was clogged and not picking anything up took it apart cleaned out the clog and vacuumed the main floor. Advertised Netflix is false, the TV's are for appearance as they are not Smart nor do they have a streaming service connection or cable/dish and the internet spent most of the time trying to connect. My daughter was unable to participate in her semester wrap-up because she could not stay connected with her school Chromebook. 

The beds were comfortable, and the linens were abundant.

When I notified the owner we would leave them on the kitchen table, the response was to ask if they also delivered large black bait stations that should go outside. We used the only (partial) roll of toilet paper the first morning and notified the owner, asking if there was more. The response was that they would have cleaners drop some off. We returned late that afternoon to no toilet paper. None was ever delivered (we had to purchase our own). My husband saw a mouse in the kitchen our last night. Would NOT recommend!

REVIEW: 
Be AWARE!!! This unit has RATS! We stayed for one night and were woken up and forced to leave the unit at 4am due to rats in our bag and eating our food that we brought for our trip. There were Rat droppings that littered the area, which we overlooked when initially checking in and assumed as dirt and debris. We informed the Host Kim and Tim who offered to compensate us for the inconvenience of having to leave abruptly as a result of their Rat infested unit. It has been over a week and the host has not communicated back or compensated us as agreed upon. I have pictures of the Rat droppings and our snacks that were chewed through. I also have the correspondence from the host where they agreed to fully compensate us. For this reason I WOULD NOT stay at this location for two reasons, 1) The host is not responsive or take responsibility for the health and safety of their guest and 2) being exposed to Rats and their fecal droppings.

REVIEW: 
Do not stay here if you have young kids crawling!!! 
Overall, the size of the house was perfect for our family. Amenities were great such as the hot tub, backyard, theater, but the overall cleanliness of the house was filthy. Our socks were black from the carpet and floors, trash was in the closets when we checked in, lots of trash in the garage, light bulbs out and not a lot of kitchen tools to cook things. What was disappointing was the heater stopped working during the night, which that night it got down to 20 degrees outside and the basement temperature was 63. For a child who just barely turned one that is a dangerous temperature to sleep in. Finally after the horrible management communication we were receiving a guy came out to look at the heater. He said it was clogged from something living in the house, maybe a mouse, bird something clogged the furnace, but he got the heater fixed after that. That next night while watching a movie in the theater we caught on camera a mouse in the kitchen. This is extremely dangerous with a child who is crawling and putting things in their mouth. I informed management about our overall stay and they didn’t care. Being a local to Cedar, wanting to support a family with this house so that our whole family could stay together, I would NOT stay here again or recommend to anyone with children. The heater and mouse were the icing on the cake. Very disappointed with our overall stay. Do not use this company or stay at this property unless you don’t care about cleanliness.

This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use other vacation rental sites all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

REVIEW: 
There are holes everywhere, in the roof in the foundation the gaps under the doors, it is a miracle it is not overrun with rodents. No surprise you are asked to keep no food or pet food out. We arrived after sundown to a dark porch. The outside light did not work. The furniture on the deck looks like it came from the landfill. The yard is covered with BB size sticker balls, awful for your pets pads, let alone human feet. We pulled about three dozen off of the rug in the living room. We were going to take a shower but when we saw the drip that flowed we decided not to. My husband was sneezing the whole time when he came across the air filter, which was totally blocked with hair. He actually tried to buy a new one at the Ace hardware, but they were out of the proper size so it is still there. Lights frequently blinked and plugs sparked when using which made us very uncomfortable with its electric service. It looks like it’s been there for 50 years without any real maintenance other than basic needs of living. Yes, it has the location, across the street and up and over the dune and you are at the ocean. Once you get to the beach, you do not wanna go back to that shack. Plus many of you may know that you need to about triple your daily rate from what is posted after the plethora of fees; this went from $83 to $220/nite. Didn’t surprise us that there’s no refunds. We would have turned around on our first day if we could get a refund! 
As it was we left early.

Summary:
While spacious with a good open main room and private picturesque setting, it was dirty and unhygienic, had insufficient cooling in the bedrooms, and a serious rat infestation. 
(Normally we give an owner a chance to fix any issues with direct, non-public feedback. This time we made a different decision to be public, to ensure accountability)

When we first arrived there were rat droppings in the living area, the kitchen and the bedrooms. Not sure how this got through “cleaning” as there were both fresh droppings and many that had clearly been there for quite some time. The rats came into the house every evening and left fresh droppings even though we left out no food. The rats repeatedly kept people awake with the noises as they knocked over and chewed non-food items. One evening when one bedroom door was closed the rats visibly chewed the carpets to get out of the bedroom under the doors. There were many unaddressed rat entry points as the ground level flyscreens were all chewed through (when we first arrived we opened the windows at night because there no was working air-conditioning in the bedrooms). After using the BBQ one evening the rats very quickly appeared on the BBQ itself before we had finished our meal (in daylight) – this was the only time that we saw the quite large rats. The owner had known about the rats before we arrived as he warned us about not leaving food out on our arrival day.

The place also had dust in many places including dust that brushed off curtains. There were stained and uncovered doonas, stinky blankets, active cobwebs and dead bugs throughout the living areas and bathrooms. The bathroom needed to be swept of bugs on arrival. Windows were dirty and smeared. This is a build up that the owners haven't bothered to deal with. One evening a cocoon/nest fell from the living room rafters onto the lounge. 

At least two bathroom doors would not latch and just blew open with a gentle breeze or with the rush of air as someone walked past.

A mother and child were stung by wasps, since – as we discovered - there was a large nest in a plant just outside the living room door on the deck. We later discovered another nest near the front door.

One air conditioning unit was broken and the “evaporative air conditioning” for the bedrooms was a complete waste of time.

absolutely filthy: blood, mucus, mice, oh my
REVIEW: 
This is hands down the dirtiest vacation rental I have ever stayed in. I don’t even know where to start. How about the sheets on the bed had dried blood/mucus on them? Dried blood was also smeared on the wall of the downstairs bathroom. There was a filled syringe of children’s Tylenol just laying out. What is going on with these cleaning services I paid for? LOL at this being sanitized per COVID regulations. 

The bunk beds are not put together correctly and sound like they are about to collapse and crush the occupants. 

One of the bedrooms is basically an unfinished construction site with a plastic bag tied around a sewer gas pipe and weird patches of subfloor showing throughout. 

THE MICE. I can understand a midnight mouse in a winter cabin but not 11am plural MICE literally running OVER my toddler completely unbothered by a room full of people. This is an infestation. 

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room. The house instructions say put a blanket over it. To protect it? Or to protect yourself? All the additional linens were just wadded up on a shelf with random socks and shoes…definitely not giving a “someone washed and folded these” vibe. 

I basically sanitized everything I have ever owned after staying here. If the price was more “drunken hangout with your buds” I would get it but we paid almost $800/night!

TITLE: 
rat poo infested home
REVIEW: 
I rented this home for Christmas with my family and was horrified when we arrived. We planned on cooking christmas dinner and relaxing while visiting yosemite and we thought this would be the perfect place for us. Upon arrival everything seemed great but once we looked closer we saw that there was rat poo all over the house. In the kitchen cabinets in the bedrooms all over the living room and even on the couches we had been sitting on. I took photos of everything and ended up having to clean up on Christmas eve because we were so disgusted. Who wants to clean up rat crap? who wants to eat off utensils that had rat poo on it? Even after cleaning it was hard to swallow the fact that there was rat poo on the plates we were using. We also had my nephew and daughter with us who are 4 and 5 and it was unsafe for them to be playing there. I'm in contact with Vrbo and am currently going back and forth about getting a refund. I also contacted Jo Ann the owner and our final email about this was so disgusting and rude. The last thing in the email she said was ""Sorry mickey came to visit"" who says that? It says a lot about who she is as a person. I have been extremely understanding, kind, and respectful. Please do not rent here. It's really expensive and if rats enter the home and poo everywhere she won't be kind about it and she will refuse to give you a refund. She kept saying in the email it was mouse poo and not rat poo like it made a difference.
