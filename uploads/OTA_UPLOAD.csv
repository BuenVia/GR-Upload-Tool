Ohne die Möglichkeit einen richtigen Sichtschutz zu haben. Die Betten und das Zimmer waren soweit in Ordnung. Das Bad war aber renovierungsbedürftig. Am nächsten Morgen um 6.00 Uhr wurden wir durch den Feueralarm geweckt. Wir zogen uns an, liefen zur Rezeption, niemand da. Im ganzen Hotel kein Personal, aber auch kein Feuer. Die anderen Gäste haben sich dann vor dem Hotel versammelt und gewartet. Um 6.45 Uhr ist dann Jemand gekommen und hat die Anlage abgeschaltet. Keine Entschuldigung vom Hotel.

We booked the room because of the location and the supposedly cheap price ... and the free parking space - so far, so good ...! The parking lot was in another hotel, just 300 m away, but in a one -way street, it took us 30 minutes to get the car there after arriving in traffic chaos. The reception was friendly, we were told that breakfast is served in the hotel, where the parking lot is also (300m away). Our room was then in the basement with a view of it. Without the opportunity to have a real privacy screen. The beds and the room were okay so far. The bathroom was in need of renovation. The next morning at 6:00 a.m. we were woken up by the fire alarm. We got dressed, ran to the reception, nobody there. No staff throughout the hotel, but also no fire. The other guests then gathered and waited in front of the hotel. At 6.45 a.m. someone came and switched off the facility. No excuse from the hotel. Breakfast was in this hotel, but we had to wait until 8 a.m. because not everything was ready. Everything a little chaotic and not really too pleasant .."

The Michelangelo Hotel in Rio Preto has been synonymous with quality and good lodging. Today is scrapped and it is not worth the price you have ever paid."

Conheço muitos hotéis no mundo dec2 a 5 estrelas ,Class Passo Fundo seguramente está entre os 5 piores hotéis que eu já me hospedei .Hotel com H MAISCULO de HORRIVEL .
Peguei 02 quartos que já haviam hóspedes indesejáveis ""Baratas"" em todos eles ,tirei fotos delas, cama desconfortáveis ,limpeza digna de hotel na rodoviária ,café da manhã fraco sem reposição o que faz vc se atrasar para seus compromissos, estacionamento apertado ,horrível de terra (se vc tem um encontro de trabalho ,o barro vai sujar seu sapato se tiver chovendo).Bom primeiro dia meu quarto não tinha papel higiênico ,não tinha toalha para o banho ,a cama parecia ter sido usada e não arrumada  e a lençol estava manchado de sangue.
Novamente afirmo ,hotel tem aparência de moderno mas a diretoria da Rede Class está destruído este hotel em Passos ,essa unidade seguramente é a pior da rede ,ter um hotel com alta ocupação não significa que ele é o melhor e não precise de manutenção ou uma gerência atuante e competente .

I know a lot of hotels in the 5 -star DeC2 Dec2, Passo Fundo is surely among the 5 worst hotels I've ever stayed. Hotel with horrible more.
I took 02 rooms that there were already undesirable guests ""cheap"" in all of them, I took pictures of them, uncomfortable bed, cleaning hotel on the bus station, weak breakfast without replacement which makes you delay to your appointments, tight, horrible parking lot of Earth (if you have a work meeting, the clay will get your shoe dirty if it was raining). Well first day my room had no toilet paper, no bath towel, the bed seemed to have been worn and not tidy and the sheet It was stained with blood.
Again, Hotel looks modern but the Class Rede board is destroyed this hotel in Passos, this unit is surely the worst in the chain, having a hotel with high occupation does not mean that it is the best and does not need maintenance or one active and competent management.
Zero grade with praise and even never again !!"

We used the hotel for an overnight stay after a wedding in Windsor.
We arrived late, as we couldn't check in early. We were shown to a room in one of the buildings that was being renovated. We were told the hotel was being upgraded when we checked in , a forewarning may have been helpful though 
The room was clean but 'tired'. My daughter and I got changed for bed then we realised that none of the plug sockets were working. We tried to get through to reception for about half an hour. We rang Hotels com to ask them to help - the 'gentleman' we spoke to was very condescending and rather rude. We had no other booking details and he refused to help.
We finally got through to reception, the young girl came over checked the sockets and said we'd have to move room. We moved next door -in our night clothes - to another room. We had a good night's sleep, although the room was cold 
The following morning my daughter was in the shower when there was a power cut. No windows in the bathroom, so she was rather worried she may fall/slip. Between then and when we checked out there were approximately four more power cuts. When we checked out we complained and was basically brushed off.
Now I know they need to renovate but think we should have been aware before booking.

Wat jammer is dat bij twee nachten totaal geen service is op de kamer. Tussendoor wordt de kamer niet schoon gemaakt en worden de bedden niet opgemaakt.

What is a pity that with two nights there is no service in the room at all. In between, the room is not cleaned and the beds are not made. If you have a heart attack, they will only find you after three days. There are sometimes no Dutch public channels. Internet is not stable and occasionally falls away. Water pressure is considerably lower if everyone takes a shower in the morning. No bath mat for the safety of the guests during the shower. The safe is super small and could not be used, especially if you bring a laptop. When cleaning, the locker should simply be checked for the next guest. Unfortunately, when checking out, it is not asked how the stay was, which is a small effort.

The restaurant is positive. The food is good and the service is pleasant and very friendly. The breakfast is extensive and great. The reception on arrival was also pleasant."

However, the sale of the accommodation is misleading, the photos released on the site is that the room is in great condition.
The room that was passed the moment we arrived was the number 310. It was smelling of mold, the fridge was rusty and without working, the discharge was clogged. We spent 3 days of stay in a room with stuffy bathroom! We requested the bedroom exchange, in which it was not resolved.
The elevator was damaged and we need to climb 3 stairs with heavy bags. The railing of the stairs is very rusty, and the entrance of the hotel too.

The hotel is unable to receive guests before a good renovation. It was extremely uncomfortable! Bad experience.

今回2泊3日で利用しました。外出するのがもったいないくらい素敵なヴィラで、部屋もプールもその他諸々大満足でした。1軒の敷地が広いのでお隣の声などは全然気になりません。
レストランは2度ほど利用しました。メニュー豊富で選ぶのも楽しいですし、なんといっても全部美味しくてハズレがありません。
スパも最高でした。とっても丁寧で、お値段もそこまで高くなく毎日利用したいほどでした。
あと、午後にはアフタヌーンティーのサービスがあります。リクエストすると部屋に持ってきていただけます。
モーニングも言わずもがな最高です。たくさん種類がありますし単品追加もできます。
今回の旅で私が怪我をしてしまったのですが、薬局まで車をだしていただいたりずっと気遣ってくださっていたのでとても安心できました。お心遣いに感謝です。

This time I used it in 2 nights and 3 days. It was a wasteful villa that was a waste to go out, and the rooms and pools were very satisfying. I don't care about the voices next to me because one site is wide.
I used the restaurant about twice. It's fun to choose with a lot of menus, and it's all delicious and there is no loss.
The spa was also the best. It was very polite and the price was not so high and I wanted to use it every day.
Also, in the afternoon there is a afternoon tea service. If you request, you can bring it to the room.
Needless to say, morning is the best. There are many types and you can add them separately.
I was injured on this trip, but I was very relieved because I had a car to the pharmacy and cared for it all the time. Thank you for your consideration.
I chose this villa in Bali for the first time and it was a great answer, and I definitely want to stay again."

務必確認房費是否包含傳藝中心入場券或其他票券。因為訂房資訊沒有提到會送入場券，我們第一天自己買票進傳藝中心玩到傍晚才入住。辦理住房時收到票券，覺得扼腕。
強烈建議請飯店將行李送到房間。沒有平整的道路直達房間。在石子路上拖行，行李箱輪子可能會損壞。退房時也可請飯店將行李送至大廳。
下雨天園區內有些道路泥濘，石板地易滑，須謹慎行走。四處可見「小心地滑」的標示。
夜間在園區的燈光及指引不足。
陽台沒有景觀，也沒有戶外桌椅，只有未經整理的竹林、枯葉，以及隔壁彷彿廢墟的建築物，還有過去住客留下的菸蒂。
響應環保，房間內不提供瓶裝水。從房間前往飲水機裝水，有一小段路是沒有走廊或棚架遮蔽的，會淋雨。
喜歡房內的獨立空調。非中央空調。易於調整溫度或運轉模式。
浴室內有明顯霉斑，木作也多有變形，充分感受到宜蘭潮濕氣候對硬體設備的影響。水壓充足、溫度穩定。
床很好睡。枕頭略低。豪華一大床僅提供兩個枕頭。
早餐提供現煮的麵食，味道不錯。其他早餐品項的口味一般。
停車場與傳藝中心共用。

Be sure to confirm whether the housing fee contains the admission voucher or other tickets. Because the booking information is not mentioned, we will send the voucher, and we buy tickets on the first day to enter the art center to play until the evening. When I received a ticket when I handled the housing, I felt frustrated.
It is strongly recommended to ask the restaurant to send your luggage to the room. There is no flat road to the room. Drag on the stone road, the luggage wheel may be damaged. You can also ask the restaurant to send your luggage to the lobby when you check out.
There are some roads in the park in the rainy days, and the slate is easy to slip, and you must walk carefully. ""Carefully slip"" marks everywhere.
The lights and guidelines in the park were insufficient at night.
There are no landscapes on the balcony, no outdoor tables and chairs, only the unpredictable bamboo forests, dead leaves, and buildings like ruins next door, and cigarette buttons left by guests in the past.
In response to environmental protection, no bottle water is provided in the room. From the room to the water dispenser to load water, there is a small section of the road without a corridor or a scaffolding, which will rain.
Like an independent air conditioner in the room. Non -central air conditioner. Easy to adjust temperature or operation mode.
There are obvious mildew in the bathroom, and the wooden works are mostly deformed. It fully feels the impact of Yilan's humid climate on hardware equipment. Poor water pressure and stable temperature.
The bed is very good to sleep. The pillow is slightly lower. There are only two pillows in a large luxury bed.
Breakfast provides cooked pasta, which tastes good. The taste of other breakfast items is average.
Parking lots are shared with the Education Center.
If the above shortcomings, if you stay in a sunny day, you must have a completely different feeling."
