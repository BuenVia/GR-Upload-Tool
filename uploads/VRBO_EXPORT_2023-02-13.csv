We called the unit manager, Jessica Jimenez, who finally got back to us after 20 minutes and gave us the code to the electronic lock. The apartment looked exactly like the images, but was not maintained well. Going out to the balcony, we found a cigarette butt and moving the accent table found it was not cleaned underneath it. The primary bedroom had no closet and the second bedroom had a closet, half fitted with shelves and the other half with a tall chest of drawers leaving 8"" on hanging on either side of the chest of drawers. The kitchen cabinets were very old and dirty... seeing our first roach within minutes of arriving. Good pots and pans, but few pieces of flatware. Baths were decent, but we had to look for bath mats that were dirty, so we washed them. The washer and dryer were very good, but was concerned about the dryer filter since the screen had holes in it and lint was going into the machine..... potential fire hazard. The TV was not working and Jessica kept telling us that the remote had to be connected to the internet. After two weeks of not being able to stream, tech person Saul came to check it out and discovered that the remote was not working. Three days later he returned and hooked up a new remote and we were able to watch TV our last week. While watching TV, we discovered crumbs that had fallen between the cushions and never cleaned up. We have been using VRBO for several years and this is the first horrible experience we have had. DO NOT rent this unit.",Fire

It’s quiet and the noise downstairs is not unbearable like I thought it could be (the loudest was the occasional overly drunk person yelling to friends down the street - the sound of happy college kids).

What wasn’t so charming was the rest of the stay and that was solely responsible by who was in charge of the rental (not the apartment or the people). The problem was the apathetic management. 

-We had to call for check-in instructions (usually those come via email and I received them four days after our stay.
-When we arrived, I knocked on the backdoor for someone to move their car so we could park there.
- The pipes were dry emitting sewer gas smells
- The temperature in the apartment was 50 degrees because the heat was off.
- There was no CO or smoke detector (it was laying on a TV stand with the battery out.
- We had to find our own bedding in the apartment and make our own beds
- We had to call for towels (which arrived quickly the next day)
- Trash cans were unlined and we had to find the liners
- The sink was dirty with someone else's shaved whiskers
- The ""goodies"" in the fridge didn't seem safe to eat based on how else everything was 'forgotten' about

It seems the expectation is that the guest will make themselves available to pack up holiday decorations that filled closets,manage housekeeping, pool maintenance,& plumbers. Issues may arise during a stay but basic maintenance should be addressed between guests - not left for the guests to address. The house was dirty- red splatters on bedroom doors, dirty toilet seat , blankets of dust on mouldings. Red food splatters on kitchen cabinet, backsplash tile and toe kick in kitchen. Scuff marks on walls, moldy caulking in shower. Washing machine was dirty and there were dirty towels in the washing machine when we arrived. Slow sink in the bathroom. 
When I told The host that I felt the cleaning service was stealing her money she became defensive and said they do a wonderful job and that she has been using them for 5 years. 
There were Missing fire alarms. Only 2 in the bedrooms. None in the rest of the house. Broken shades in den. No information about the area attractions, restaurants, grocery store, - although the host was aware that a previous guest had taken the book there was no replacement. Extension cords that are staples to wall used to plug in lamps. 
The 4th bedroom is in the ‘guest cottage’ which would have been fine for us IF it was clean, didn’t smell musty and if people staying in there were able to access the main house at night after the doors to the house were locked. The back door to the yard from the main house didn’t close correctly so they put 2 slide bolts on it. Because of this anyone staying in the guest house would have to exit the yard and walk around to the front door to unlock it with a key. The only other access would be through a bedroom which would be awkward to leave unlocked while people are sleeping in the room. 
The pool heater not on. Had to flip on circuit breaker while being directed by host and program heater-heater not working and pool needed to be shocked .
The AC compressor in the side yard next to back door has fencing around it that is in disrepair and literally fell down every day- very disappointing Major construction going on next door- had to finally leave early bc we couldn’t sit outside from noise and debris coming over the fence.

Without an alternative, we stayed in the unit and had to be extra cautious with our kids and how we used the electricity. We were lucky that no one was injured. Prior to traveling we reached out regarding previous issues raised in recent reviews, we were assured that items were fixed, but things such as the king bed still had two large divots. False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations. Recommend staying away from Vacasa rentals, and potentially any property that they have a unit in such as Tyra since unsafe electrical conditions could lead to a fire within the whole building.

From a licensed electrician view (I am a 32 years Master licensed electrician)If the main breaker is tripping then you have a fire hazard. I hope they get this fixed immediately. Through all this issue they offered us some very cheap condo instead and not another house. So we had to stay the 2nd night in the house again afraid to sleep or run the heater or anything that may cause an electrical fire. This was January so it got down in the 30's at night. Cold house cold shower sucked.

My daughters bday weekend was ruined. Thank god the things I had planned refunded us most of our money back. I just think this place should do the same. I felt overcharged in the beginning due to being off season and it was only 2 nights. I want a complete refund let's see if they will do the right thing. Still debating if I should do my licensed duty by calling the fire marshal on you which would cost you in major fines if not shut you down completely to do a complete investigation on a your properties.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo.

The pool was great and frequently used. There were a number of not well publicized surprises that would make me think twice before renting the property again:

1. At precisely 9:00 am everyday, daily flight sorties commence overhead with fighter jet training exercises. It is nearly to converse while this is happening.

2. The cooking furnishings are fairly spartan for such a property making it near difficult to cook large meals for a group of six. Things that we would otherwise take for granted like cutting boards, salt/pepper, kitchen towels were not to be found. What was there was very limited relative to other comparably priced VRBO's we have rented previously.

3. The one meal we did cook resulted in 30 minutes of smoke alarm hell. Best we could tell the oven vent is not vented to the outside so any minor smoke set them off. Once tripped, the affected ones had to be individually reset.

4. The outside ceiling fans did not function and one had a broken blade which might explain why they were shut off at the breaker.

Also the smoke alarm kept going off due to the battery needing replacing so we just took it down and left it on the table inside doorway so others would not experience it going off all night.
My main concern was the inability to get hold of anyone if needed. We had been made homeless due to flooding in auckland the week prior and requested consideration due to the state of emergency declared in auckland. Tried to get hold of the owners for 3 days prior to our holiday to discuss this but no one was able to get hold of anyone. It just would have been nice to have had an answer as to whether a cancelation or deferral of the booking was possible due to the extreme circumstances, but we ended up going as it was too expensive to lose.

We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place. Some of the sheets/comforters were clearly stained with makeup and crusty with what looked like bodily fluids on them... Surely a health and safety concern. The lock on the large TV room door was broken and did not lock. The master bathroom had what looked like puke on the walls. 

Unfortunately, our stay was during record low temperatures, so we had to wear multiple layers of clothing and start a fire to stay warm, however, the damp wood and half-functioning flue caused smoke to fill the home. The downstairs basement bedroom was incredibly cold, with temperatures barely exceeding 55 degrees. Many bedrooms did not have proper window coverings. 
The high foot-traffic areas were also dangerously icy and there was champagne (or some other substance) sprayed on the ceiling in the living room. The dishes in the cabinets were still dirty with lipstick on them and the carpets throughout the house were stained with suspicious-looking fluids, all of which are health and safety concerns. 
I relayed this list of issues to Vacasa and they did compensate us with 10% back from the price of our stay. This is why I am (generously) awarding 3 stars...",Fire

Unbelievable!

Management was insistent that we were not following the instructions for the mechanicals and did nothing. Since no one was coming to fix this issue we took time from our vacation to investigate and found that the exterior shut off valve was closed. We do not feel the pool and spa fees were properly disclosed to a renter before officially renting the home. The ice maker did not work and when reported the manager he turned it on and water froze all over the interior of the freezer but never made ice. His ""fix"" was just o turn it back off. The garbage cans on the home's exterior were full and we needed to notify the management so we were not charged for excessive garbage!

It would seem that she is very busy lady with a lot of responsibilities, and not much time to dedicate to this vacation rental, or the needs of it's tenants. Eighteen friends and I have a yearly retreat, and our former lodging, a home in Heber was sold. This place seemed perfect for us, and it even had a hot tub, and beds for 21. Only we found out when we got there that there were only beds for 17, and the hot tub was broken. And things went downhill from there. The kitchen electrical circuit kept flipping off, and we learned that to use the microwave, we had to unplug everything else in the kitchen, including the stove. Also, a bedroom and the only bathroom in the basement had zero working outlets. When I texted Corinn about the electrical issues, she said no one had ever had issues like that before, so it followed that we could not be having those issues. When we checked the reviews, we saw that others had complained about the electrical issues. She did own that the hot tub was awaiting a part, and apologized. We all showed up with bathing suits-- such a disappointment! Then around 9 pm, a city water main broke, leaving us with no running water, no flushing toilets, until about 2:00 the next afternoon. So we spent several hours gathering snow in large bowls and melting it, oh so tediously, on the stove, a process that resumed again for several hours in the morning.
I reached out to Corinn the night of the water crisis and she said she would bring us drinking water the next morning, only she didn't. We kept melting snow and purchased drinking water and water to wash the dishes by hand. In addition, many commonly needed items were completely lacking -- kitchen basics like dish towels and extra paper towels, sharp knives, etc. The only thing to wash the dishes with were a couple of old, worn, mildewy sponges. At least 2 upstairs smoke detectors were broken, disconnected, and stashed in dressers. The basement bedroom with no working outlets also had no nightstands or bedside lighting or rugs on the cold floor. The television remote control had dead batteries, and no extras anywhere.

Typically if I am not satisfied with an experience, I just don’t leave a review. I am making an exception in this case because this host scammed me out of $185 (which I am currently disputing).

The beach and setting are nice. The building is old and dilapidated. Unpleasant odors in the unit and around the building. Door locks/scanner for fitness room were broken. Smoke or air detector in unit was constantly beeping for no apparent reason. There is construction in process, so it’s loud, and reserved parking spot is regularly used by others. Regular work truck traffic also blocks entry and parking. Shower has very weak water pressure and takes a long time to heat up. Pool is tiny. No hot tub.

I would have ignored all of this however, if the host hadn’t stuck me with a completely BOGUS “cushion damage/laundering” fee of $185 after my stay. I made multiple attempts to communicate with him regarding the erroneous charge, to try and get some clarity on the matter, but was completely ignored. There is absolutely no way we caused any damage to his cushions! We barely used them and everything looked just the way we found it when we left. The host lives on the mainland. I know this because I mailed his parking pass back to him. So, he is either dishonest OR he got bad info from his property manager.

But there is a decent lack of attention to detail and management oversight. 

I'm a property manager of vacation rentals so I'm the first to say I'm pickier than most guests. It is nicely decorated but not functional. Managers/owners should stay in their rentals as a test run and see it from the guests perspective.

Pretty cobblestone entrances are for home owners and designers, not vacation rentals. No one wants to drag several heavy bags of luggage over that. Especially with your elderly parent, uneven surfaces are a hazard. It was in the 40s that week, the house was freezing upon arrival and we accidentally hit the security/fire alarm trying to turn on the heat and that went off for 10 minutes. I wrote the manager who didn't seem to know there was an alarm or how to turn it off. No notes anywhere on how to operate things. The Hot and Cold valve is backwards in the shower; try waiting for that to heat up while stand there freezing cold and naked. The master bed frame broke making my sister in law to sleep on the couch freezing because no one could figure out the heater mechanism on the wall. Way too difficult to operate. And calling it a 4 bedroom is a stretch, its a 3 bedroom with a game room. 

We asked for help but didn't get it on the items of most concern alarm/bedframe/heater. Nice house, mediocre management. Sorry! There's actually more but Vrbo is cutting me off :)",Fire

Positives of the house and our stay: great location to Deer Valley resort, large living areas, and beautiful views.

Unfortunately the negatives vastly outnumbered the positives. It started Wednesday when we realized warm water was a luxury and hard to come by. Barely any of the sinks and showers produced hot water and if you were lucky to get it, it went away almost immediately. 

Thursday we had a toilet that would not flush. In a house with 8 adults and 8 kids, you really rely on all toilets to work properly!

The hiccups continued into Friday night when we were abruptly awoken at midnight by blaring music from the living room wall speakers. We thought the house was possessed! None of us had connected to the sonos speaker system so we have no idea how it started playing out of nowhere! 

The nighttime disasters culminated the next night/morning. At 340am on Sunday the fire alarm in the master bedroom began to ring. We confirmed There was no fire, no emergency. It rang for 5 mins and stopped. Then restarted and stopped. The ringing continued every few mins for two hours!!! It could be heard throughout the home and everyone’s sleep was ruined. We called the emergency after hours phone number for assistance to no avail. No call back, no response. This is unacceptable! 

We had a terrible experience at this house and with Opulent Vacations and will not be returning.

We were not asking for the world, just the basics.",Fire

While the access to the building was easy, upon entering our unit #304 - we were overwhelmed with the smell of gas that hit us when we entered.

Not knowing how long that had been on - we quickly contacted you, were ready to contact the fire department, turned off the stove - and had to open all the windows and doors for a long while until the smell dissipated, then flee outside as we felt very unsafe.
 
Not a very warm welcome to Sonder property. 

Also, the unit was not what we expected in a scene of care and cleanliness. A few things: 

Bathtub in the first bath had a huge drain issue, and did not drain, leaving me to stand in gross water - then the next day the shower was so slippery from the residual soap - that it was super dangerous. 

The dishes in the cabinet were dirty - literally feel like a guest may have loaded the dishwasher - not run it, then housekeeping thought it was clean and put it away. So disgusting. 

The sheets in the guest bathroom appeared to have dried blood stains on them. 

NOTE: I reached out directly to the property managment company, Sonder directly to address this before sharing this review. The first attempt went completely ingnored, and the second attempts months later was met with a sorry, we will do better next time. Sorry, for me - there will certainly not be a next time.",Fire

We had no issue lighting the fire, the wood was there and they provided fire starter with matches. However, upon lighting fire we found the seal around the glass on the door was letting smoke in house with door shut. We proceeded to put the fire out and used the space heater and wall unit in bedroom. The wall unit makes the bedroom feel like a sauna but does not heat the rest of the house at all. We contacted host, and left the very next morning (we would have left that night, however, it was too late and no transportation was available) , the musty (potentially mouldy) smell was awful and made it difficult to breath through the night.

The location of this unit is excellent. It’s super close to the slopes and we had a good view from the balcony to see our kids going down the slope. It was right next to the laundry room too, which was really convenient. There was a good selection of cookware and dishes in the unit, as well as a blender and a crockpot. The weren’t very many spoons/forks but we brought our own plasticware and disposable cups/plates/bowls so we were set. The listing indicated there was a Keurig, but there was not - there was a Mr. Coffee brewer so the k-cups we brought with us were useless. 

I’ve never stayed at any of the other condos in this complex so I cannot say how this one compares to the others, I can only share my experience/observations. 

Between beds, bunks and a pullout sofa, it slept eight. There was only enough seating for four people unless you used the barstools. The beds weren’t terrible, but they weren’t great either. Probably depends on what you’re used to. I’m told the bunks slept terrible. 

First thing we noticed when we arrived was the smoke alarm just inside the entry was hanging by wires and was covered with a plastic bag. Having no idea what was going on, we left it as it was. In addition to that, the toilet in main bath was shimmed on one side and didn’t appear to be properly attached to the floor, as it sometimes lifted off floor if you moved a certain way while using it. There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again.",Fire

The house comes equipped with everything you'd need for a great stay. Beds and couches were comfortable. The kitchen is well-equipped and the place has games, a pool table, TVs, etc. 

We had two significant issues during our visit. The first relates to the temperature of the house, which we were told is at 55 degrees when not in use (in theory, we're all for this for energy conservation purposes). But it was colder than that when we arrived. Guests are supposed to use two built-in wall units to heat the house and aren't supposed to use the in-room radiators. This was really impractical. WITH the radiators and two space heaters, it took about 24 hours for the house to get up to a comfortable temperature (temps outside were between 20-35 degrees at first). One in-room bedroom radiator wasn't working, so that bedroom was out of commission for us. 

The second issue was with the upstairs fireplace. After checking to see that the damper was open and creating a good draft through the flue, our fire lit well but spewed an unusual amount of smoke into the house - so much so that we had to extinguish it. My guess is the chimney hadn't been cleaned properly. 

Raj was extremely responsive and helpful throughout. He seemed genuinely surprised about the heat and fire issues and tried asking around to see if anything could be done. Upon seeing that the temps were to drop to below zero on our third night, he had an extra space heater shipped to us. And upon being unable to sort out the fireplace issues, he volunteered to refund us for one out of our four nights. This was greatly appreciated, and he seems committed to making his guests' experiences positive. Five-star service, support, and communication. 

I will note a couple of other small issue that arose. One is the hot tub, which was inviting and warm but not quite 'hot' (though I will mention the weather was very cold outside). The other was that though there is a travel crib available, sheets for it were not. Not something I care about a lot, but others might.

Given Raj's sincere efforts to help and improve this experience, I expect future guests enjoy staying here even more than we did. But given how many options there are in the Poconos and how expensive they all are, we'd probably choose somewhere else next time.",Fire

I would have loved seeing the beautiful view from the master, but the electronic blinds did not go up. When I asked the maintenance man (who was there fixing our heat) about it he said they were waiting on a part to fix them. That was a huge disappointment considering what we paid for the view.

Why am I so glowing in my review? Well, we had a snafu in our original plans. Two families (4 adults and 6 young children) checked into a different house. One snowstorm later (great for skiing, less-so for our housing), our original home was without electricity, running water, or heat. The management company promised us we'd ""be taken care of"", but by 6 PM the power wasn’t on and the management company abdicated their responsibility--we were stuck and left homeless.

After a quick Vrbo search, we came upon Mike & April's abode. They quickly responded and lent a hand, made their home available that same night, and immediately got the house cleaned/prepped. Within hours, our travel group was nestled into Mike & April's warm, welcoming home.

The rest of our stay was blessedly uneventful with 4 comfortable nights at Mike & April's. It fit our 2 families easily, was well-maintained, and truly made our vacation! Throughout our time, Mike & April were available for anything we may have needed and made us feel welcome and at home.

With this being a converted attic it was brutally cold and that radiator heater is so very dangerous, had it caused a fire our exit would have been scary given we were in a home behind a broken steel gate that had to be opened/closed by hand upon arrival/leaving.

We complained regarding the heat and electricity not working from the 1st night. 

Being transparent would’ve been letting us know that there would not be efficient electricity and heat provided to all the rooms. There are basic expectations for a rental, such as a roof, electricity, heat, and walls. These are not items that any renter should “reach out and ask questions or be concerned about before booking” 
Should I have also reached out and asked before I arrived if there was a roof? Electricity and heat are basic needs that should have been met every time someone rents a home in a place as cold as Mammoth. Unless you specifically state in your description of the home that heat and electricity MAY NOT be available at all times, which it was not. 
I wish I looked at the reviews before I rented because I am obviously not the first person to complain of the exact same two things the breaker feeling, which means no electricity and heat not working properly. 

“Greatly apologizing my for the inconvenience and difficulties” of being cold and lacking electricity is not ok. “Promising to have this issue resolved in the future”does not help me, because I will never stay here again. Neither is “Feeling my great disappointment” 
We stayed there cold, and lacking electricity because there weren’t any other places to stay. 

Having basic necessities such as heat, and electricity in Mammoth is something that should not be “looked into” it should be mandatory and MUST at all times. We all left the house and weekend sniffling and feeling as if we were on the verge of being sick.

We complained regarding the heat and electricity not working from the 1st night. 

Being transparent would’ve been letting us know that there would not be efficient electricity and heat provided to all the rooms. There are basic expectations for a rental, such as a roof, electricity, heat, and walls. These are not items that any renter should “reach out and ask questions or be concerned about before booking” 
Should I have also reached out and asked before I arrived if there was a roof? Electricity and heat are basic needs that should have been met every time someone rents a home in a place as cold as Mammoth. Unless you specifically state in your description of the home that heat and electricity MAY NOT be available at all times, which it was not. 
I wish I looked at the reviews before I rented because I am obviously not the first person to complain of the exact same two things the breaker feeling, which means no electricity and heat not working properly. 

“Greatly apologizing my for the inconvenience and difficulties” of being cold and lacking electricity is not ok. “Promising to have this issue resolved in the future”does not help me, because I will never stay here again. Neither is “Feeling my great disappointment” 
We stayed there cold, and lacking electricity because there weren’t any other places to stay. 

Having basic necessities such as heat, and electricity in Mammoth is something that should not be “looked into” it should be mandatory and MUST at all times. We all left the house and weekend sniffling and feeling as if we were on the verge of being sick.

- I arrived on a Saturday, during a rain storm, to leaks in both master bedroom and living room (all over sofa). I immediately contacted owner who lives close by but instead of coming over to look, she instructed me to put pots out to collect dripping water and that a roofer would come by Monday. Monday it was fixed but she left the dirty leak collecting pots in the sink for me to clean myself. Had I been the owner, I would have left a bottle of nice wine and an apology note, not a pile of dirty pots for my renter to clean. 

- The dishwater is faulty and did not clean dishes, It would run, but the dishes were still filthy after a cycle. I am an adult and quite familiar with using dishwashers, the owner instead of coming by to see for herself decided to give me a lesson on how to work the dishwasher. Regardless, I can attest that after 5 cycles the dishes never got clean. So, I spent two weeks having to hand washing all the dirty dishes. 

- The power went out one night in the middle of the night and I had to contact the owner. Thankfully, it was restored fairly quickly but no utility contact/account info was given in her inadequate ""welcome book"", so I was unable to get updates as to when the power would return. 

- The garage door is controlled by a digital lock with code but the system is funky and gave me trouble a few times. Additionally the garage is very small. The front door digital lock with code is also difficult, it seems to time out and the only thing to do is wait 15 minutes for it to reset. I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. This is a basic safety issue and for this reason alone the apartment should not be rented until it is corrected. 

- Finally, the washer and dryer are in a janky downstairs room which is very grimy. The washer/dryer is not listed in the ""welcome book"" forcing me to inquire (yet again) about their whereabouts and usage. 

- I travel and use short term rentals 6-8 times per year and this experience was pretty awful. Wendy the owner was “mostly” responsive but consistently condescending. She also offered no credit for any of the above issues. Well, she did offer to let me out of my contract a few days early but it wasn’t worth leaving at that point.

He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often. 

Next day we noticed the bathroom in the room on the right has no power outlet. Ironically, there is a hair dryer though.
The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far). 
Got home after a long day and ran to the bathroom (long shuttle ride) just to slip on a pool of water and dislocate my knee! Water was dripping out of the back of the toilet tank. I turned off the water and called/texted management for help. No one even responded until the next day!

Sigh...we booked this place for a ten night stay in Salt Lake over the Christmas and New Year holidays. We checked in on the 23rd and walked into an attic apartment with no heat. It was 28 degrees outside AND inside the place. We could literally see our breath, standing next to the bed. 

Once I discovered there was no power to the thermostat, I contacted the property manager who, up until the day of check-in, had been very communicative. He (Eddie) told me he had never heard of this problem and asked me to send him a picture of the thermostat, my name, and the address to the property where we were staying. Um, okay. I did that and he told me he would get back to me. Luckily we had family to meet and we were able to go to dinner somewhere that allowed us to keep our car running so the dogs didn't freeze. 

While we were still under the assumption that the heater would be fixed eventually, we bought a space heater at Costco ($90) and a bag of ice melt ($10) to try to remove the snow and ice that were frozen on the Excorcist-style metal staircase. Oh, a couple more fun facts - there was no lightbulb over the door at the top of the stairs and also no mat outside the door to keep from tracking everything onto the kitchen floor. 

I'm going to spare the frustrating story of my texts back and forth with Eddie about the heater not working, the neighbors trying to flip the breaker, and the property manager not being able to reach a technician because it was Christmas and just skip to the part where Eddie told me his solution was to cancel our reservation and issue a refund. Whaaaaaaat???

And so...we had no where to stay. On Christmas, with two big dogs and a truck full of the things needed to live life away from home for ten days. We ended up finding a place eventually, but had to pay another $1000+ on top of the $900 we had already paid to VRBO. 

Eddie told us on December 23rd that we would received a refund. We received it (after multiple texts and emails,) on January 5th. 

I understand this apartment is only used as a rental property. It's bare bones, which would have been fine if there had been heat. There were towels set out for us, so it looked like someone had prepared the place for our stay. Only no one had prepared.

There was not any shampoo, soap, laundry detergent, extra garbage bags (only 1 provided) nor directions where to put trash. There were hairs in the bedsheets. Host never emailed the wifi info beforehand as the platform clearly said should have been done, and we only get it several hours later after asking. 

On check out, host told me to message her directly on WhatsApp to reserve instead of the platform, a clear violation of VRBO’s rules and regulations. She then bombarded us with unwanted messages and solicitations afterwards. 

She also told us the 2 people before us mentioned they also had no direction where to put any trash either. And that they take care of it and laundry, when I told her we washed towels. Clean ones were in the dryer and ones that need to be washed were in the washer. This did not need to be done by us, but was done anyways. Despite this, host sent a picture of little pieces of unneeded papers afterwards. 

There was also a non disclosed video camera recording the unit which is also another huge violation of VRBO’s policies.

Inside home was nice, with a nice garden, however no view of the pool as listed in the description. 
 
TV in extra bedroom did not work properly, and cut out every 10 seconds to a black screen for 10 seconds. 

Host also tried to trick us into in earlier check out time than what was listed in the VRBO. Luckily I had a screen shot of the correct check out time. But, I should not have had to go through that. Host also asked us our arrival time at least 3-4 times beforehand even though we had already sent that info each time it was asked.

Beds were very comfortable, but there was only one thick/firm style of pillow that will not work for stomach sleepers.
Pool or ocean are both a 5 minute walk away. And you are in walking distance to a few different restaurants. Twisted Lime was my personal fave. Just make sure you aren't starving before you get to the restaurant as service is quite a bit slower than we are used to in Canada. 
NOTE: Bon Vivants cafe and cocktail bar is directly below the primary bedroom. If you are an early to bed person, this would be an issue due to the late-night noise. However, we didnt understand hurricane doors - you have to pull the handle up to make the door shut properly. We didn't figure this out until midstay, which lessened the noise.
We went with our two children, 10 and 12, and felt quite safe. 
You can take the #10 bus to downtown Nassau. Route goes along the coast and is about a 20 minute ride. Bus can be caught anywhere on the side of the main road by flagging them down. And when you want to get off, just say ""bus stop"". Fare is $1.50 per person. NOTE: Do NOT take the #10A is this route winds inland and takes significantly longer. Cabs were more expensive than we were expecting, and they charge additional for more than two people ($50 to downtown one way for 5 people).
Overall, a really great place to stay, but everything was significantly more expensive than we were expecting in the Bahamas.",Electrical - Power Outage

We would have liked to spend more time on the balcony, but the chairs were too uncomfortable. The balcony handrails were all rusted and needed repair, while the neighboring condo rails were in great shape. We were allowed in early to enjoy the pool/beach, as the cleaning lady knew she had to work well after 5PM to make it right for us from the mess left behind from the previous renter. She was super! There were dirty dishes left in the dishwasher undone, & a frying pan with food still attached was found in the oven. We had to clean all the utensils, pots, & dishes that we wanted to use before we could use them. There was minimal TV service, & were told upon check-in that we would have to have our own subscription to Hulu, or Netflix etc, which we don""t subscribe to.

The master bath shower area is cave-like & really needed a power vent to remove the moisture, but that was broken. The stove top is barely working, as the touch pad is so worn it is difficult to adjust the temperature & to turn on & off. The paint on the ceiling is peeling off in the common kitchen area, & the refrigerator water/ice machine with the filter is inop so no potable water.

I contacted Grand Welcome on VRBO website, text, phone - NO RESPONSE.

First positives- place is in great condition/decor and great location, 24 on call property management was responsive during stay during power outage

Negatives- 
1) Biggest problem was advertised hot tub was NEVER useable and property managers knew this according to our conversations. I also have written texts from Grand Welcome employee stating will be compensated/reimbursed for nonuseable hot tub but this NEVER happened. I contacted Grand Welcome on VRBO website, text, phone - NO RESPONSE. I really didn't want to leave a bad review but this was poor follow through adn we had many other property options without hot tubs that we passed up for this place. 

2) when power went out no guest access to reset router (which is needed and frequent power outages though short here), so hopefully owners will move to guest accessible area for future.

There had been a power outage and we could not get reception for tv's. He did everything he could to help us and the problem was resolved. The new refrigerator with an ice maker was a welcome addition. Bedding is very nice and so is furniture. The back patio has a beautiful view of the Catalina Foothills and is a very quiet area. It is also very close to restaurants and grocery stores. The spare bedroom was nice and so is the second bathroom. Cons: We did notice some areas that could use some attention from last year.

This was the ""Penthouse end unit"" I rented. I had the misconception that it meant a larger wrap around deck which it didn't. I arrived to the unit at 5 pm only to find the parking lot covered in the most disgusting mud I have ever seen. About a third of the parking lot was so deeply covered in mud you couldn't park so the rest of the spaces in the lot were always taken. I found a narrow slit to park in and slipped and slid all the way to the entrance. I ruined my new shoes as were covered in mud. This was from rains that occurred earlier in the week. The streams pouring on to the street and into the ocean there were carrying the mud from the mountainside and putting it everywhere including the beach and water which was now the color of my morning coffee. The unit itself is a well used rental and looks the part. The television in the living room was watchable but never managed to figure how to stream as I believe it wasn't connected to the wifi. The bedroom tv was postage stamp size which I never turned on. The unit had most everything there but just all basic and nothing one would consider luxury. Furniture was well used and just left the impression of minimal amounts to get the job done. The coup d' etat was that we were told to move our cars to clean the parking lot. The problem is there is nowhere to park your car off property and it was a half mile round trip for me to park my car and then I was stuck in the mud in the process. Totally uncalled for. The worst part was I sent a note to the manager explaining my displeasure but was told basically, mahalo. On top of that, when we finally decided to try the television after dinner to watch something the power went out for 2.5 hours. The best part was the beach to the south was most interesting and a great place to watch sea life and the sunset. When you check in they require you to get a parking pass and such. The problem is they are only open from 9 am to 2pm which is difficult since you can't check in until 3 pm. The last straw was it was unit 601 which is directly on the street of Kihei blvd and so the noise was ungodly. I never, ever would have rented a unit like this in that location but you don't know. The view was even compromised and the picture they use is from the one angle you could actually see the water decently. During a zoom call I had to mute my mic due to the noise.",Electrical - Power Outage

Monday it was fixed BUT she actually left me the pots in the sink to clean myself!! Unreal. I would have left a bottle of good wine if it was my place! The dishwater did not clean dishes adequately.

The front door punch code is also a pain in the ass and I was locked out after midnight one night and the owner did not return my texts until 6am. Not ok and not safe. Additionally, the washer and dryer are in a janky room downstairs and very grimy. It also isn’t listed in her welcome book and I needed to inquire about their whereabouts and usage.

-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room

It is spotless, beautifully decorated, furnished with everything you could possibly need and in a nice location. The condo was a perfect size for 4 adults. The slight ocean view was a sliver above the palms trees but the mountain view was beautiful. Dining on the patio was a nice option. The screens were restricted from use and mosquitoes were coming in so we had to be sure to close the doors at night
That being said, the building itself and property were a bit of a let down. The check in process was confusing. The valet informed us that the elevator on our side of the building was not operational (it never was fixed all week) so we needed to use the fire stairs which we did to avoid an extremely long walk to another elevator. The cranes erected across from our building were an obstruction to the view and work started every morning at 8. The pools were on the murky side and not very desirable for swimming. The amount of people reserving pool chairs with their belongings made finding a chair to use next to impossible. Signs warn that this isn’t allowed but I never saw any enforcement. The store on the first floor had a lot of items but the freezer was also broken all week so items like pizzas, ice cream and other frozen products were unavailable. Parking in the garage was almost always full after 6 pm (according to valet) so we opted to park in an open lot that was a short walk to our building. The towel lending process of scanning towels in and out worked fine. The food served around the property from Dukes was a plus. The staff at the recreational rental booth was great. When a group of 10 or more staying a few units down began smoking continuously on their balcony each day we informed the valet who said she would notify security and that was quickly rectified. We truly felt that the unit was way nicer than the building and the property. I would assume this is hard for the owner of the unit who may have little or no control over the general running of the building. Don’t go expecting a resort. This is a very beautiful condo in an ok building. It appears that the cranes will be around for a while since they are painting all of the balconies and buildings exteriors.

A beautiful house with ample space for eating together and lounging around the pool. We really appreciated the very large ensuite bathrooms in every room, as well as one in the main area. Great pool. Stunning views of whales, sunrises, and sunsets! 

Cons:
The surrounding neighborhood has a number of derelict buildings and has a run down feeling.

On arrival, the pool was full of green slime. However, it was cleaned by the next day.
The kitchen is very outdated, small and in disrepair. It is quite grimy and there are ants everywhere. Microwave not functioning properly. The fridge shelf fell off and broke when the door was opened. Although the fridge is old, the owner expected we would pay for the entire cost of a new shelf. We settled for paying 50%.

We had arranged with Ana-Laura to have some dinners prepared for us by a local couple. The arrangement was that we would pay them 700 pesos plus costs for groceries. Unfortunately they would never give us receipts and grossly overcharged us… the groceries would have cost less than ⅓ what they asked for. Ana-Laura didn’t seem to care or attempt to make amends.

There was no hot water in two of the four bathrooms during the whole length of our stay as one of the two propane tanks was empty. So half of our group never had hot water.

The pillows were very uncomfortable. This accommodation is in great need of updating and thorough cleaning. One expects a certain level when paying such a high price per night.",Pool Unclean Water

We immediately got stuck sideways in the driveway and had to wait an hour for the rest of our group to arrive to help push the car out of a snowbank. We were only able to make it out using a busted piece of plywood we had found in the garage. Only 2 of our 4 cars could make it up the driveway throughout the entirety of our stay. The Vacasa listing mentions 4wd is necessary, however the VRBO listing makes no such claim. There was no way for us to know this before we had booked the home, so I think this is important for future guests to know about. 

Once inside, we immediately found the dining room window shattered and sloppily covered in cardboard. When I notified Vacasa about the window and the missing cabinet door in the kitchen (which had clearly been ripped off) they seemed to be surprised. They were kind enough to send an employee out to patch the window with plywood and packing tape, however they did not come back to plow/salt the driveway like they said they would. 

The hot tub water was murky and smelled terrible. This was especially disappointing, as the hot tub was a large part of why we had booked the house in the first place. Some of the sheets/comforters were clearly stained with makeup and crusty with what looked like bodily fluids on them... Surely a health and safety concern. The lock on the large TV room door was broken and did not lock. The master bathroom had what looked like puke on the walls. 

Unfortunately, our stay was during record low temperatures, so we had to wear multiple layers of clothing and start a fire to stay warm, however, the damp wood and half-functioning flue caused smoke to fill the home. The downstairs basement bedroom was incredibly cold, with temperatures barely exceeding 55 degrees. Many bedrooms did not have proper window coverings. 
The high foot-traffic areas were also dangerously icy and there was champagne (or some other substance) sprayed on the ceiling in the living room. The dishes in the cabinets were still dirty with lipstick on them and the carpets throughout the house were stained with suspicious-looking fluids, all of which are health and safety concerns. 
I relayed this list of issues to Vacasa and they did compensate us with 10% back from the price of our stay. This is why I am (generously) awarding 3 stars...",Pool Unclean Water

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.",Stairs

However, there were some details that made us wish we had just gotten a hotel. Properties like this are the epitome of the poor STR offerings that are now commonplace.

First: This property is managed by a professional company. It is weird and inconvenient that they require guests to have to first visit an offsite location during their available office hours to check-in.

Second, the amount of messages and forms we were subject to after booking was dizzying. Once we had already booked and paid on VRBO, we were forced to fill out pages of additional forms via links with extra signatures and personal information, and then fill that information again in-person during check-in. They even prompted us to install another additional app altogether just for a 2-night stay. There were house rule sheets fed to us at every turn: in the emails, forms, on printouts, on the contracts, hanging in the home. I felt unwelcome by the end of it. The point is: booking through VRBO should be the sole source of our registration info and the house rules. All this extra stuff felt very unwelcoming.

Third: the home entrance itself was difficult to access. I wish I could post a photo, because the narrow stairs leading to the front door had at least a 3-inch thick later of slippery ice on top. It was almost comical how difficult it was to walk up the steps without assistance. We had to tag-team bringing in our bags because it was so dangerous to walk up. We couldn't have dealt with the ice if we'd wanted: all they provided was a cheap plastic snow shovel that couldn't come close to busting the ice. I can't believe they didn't clear the walkway and salt the steps before admitting guests.

Fourth: the instructions call for guests to take their garbage to the dump, after charging a cleaning fee! As paying guests (and as a short-term rental host myself), I had to laugh that these people require their guests to go run errands for them around town just to go check out. These hosts are a local company -- they can go make the garbage run to the dump themselves.

Needless to say, we won't be coming back to Big Bear anytime soon and I do not recommend Big Bear Vacations.",Stairs

Not close to other cabins, nice view, and the house had everything we needed inside. The kitchen was perfectly stocked, above and beyond what is typically provided (still bring some extra paper towels, trash bags, and dishwasher pods with you, just in case). Beds and rooms were comfortable; both levels in the house have their own thermostats for comfortable temperature settings. Great natural light everywhere, and functional window coverings for privacy, in spite of large windows everywhere. We also really enjoyed the firepit - just remember to bring your own firewood, as it is not provided.

The only negative sides of the stay had to do with the quality of the construction. There doesn't appear to be any sound insulation between the two floors; it is extremely noisy downstairs when anyone as little as gets out of bed or walks across the room upstairs.

There is hardly any water pressure, if more than one faucet is used at the same time. With four full bathrooms in the house, this was an issue while trying to get ready in the AM, or cleaning up after hikes and activities.

There was a leak from an upstairs bathroom that was coming out on the stair steps; not a huge leak, but big enough to make those steps slippery and unsafe, if we didn't catch it.

There were several very large pieces of siding that came detached from the roof of the patio, and were hanging down very low, looking like they could fall off on our heads any minute. Made a large portion of the upstairs patio unusable during our stay. and we didn't really have a safe way to walk to the outdoor patio fireplace we wanted to use.

Last, but not least - don't attempt getting there in a low-rider small car that is weighted down with people and luggage. The road is very windy and steep, and there is a big gravel/dirt hump in the middle, which would have made things difficult for a lower smaller car.

Overall, good experience, and I am sure the property management will address the ""maintenance"" issues above (they were already beginning work on them when we called them in). If you're ok with ear plugs for the lack of sound insulation, and don't mind low water pressure, AND you drive at least a higher sedan or a crossover - this is a wonderful place for the whole family to enjoy!

We were looking for a house with direct beach access as we were getting married on the beach and figured that would be easier than getting ready and having to drive somewhere else for the ceremony. The house IS beautiful with breathtaking views. It is very spacious. There are a lot of steps though. There is a whole bathroom and a suite with a king bed and en suite bathroom on the top floor along with a living room and kitchen. We put my grandparents in that bedroom so they didn't have to use the stairs except to leave.

The boardwalk and porch stairs can be slippery when wet so be careful in the morning and when it rains. The kitchen is well stocked so cooking is easy (except lack of dish towels). Definitely bring your own paper towels and toilet paper as the stuff they leave for you are terrible. Also bring extra blankets and towels. They do have some beach chairs and umbrellas!

The only reason I docked a star is because of the hot water. I guess the property hadn't been used in a while so the hot water smelled like rotten eggs. Badly. The smell filled the entire house. I called the office our first night there because if we were going to need a different property I wanted to deal with it night one so we could focus on the wedding. Someone from the office called about an hour and a half later, instructed us to just run the water and see if the smell goes away. We did exactly that in every faucet and shower. The smell did go away, but it filled the entire house. We had left to go to Night of Lights, dinner, and ice cream. The smell was so strong we could smell it even outside when we returned several hours later. It would be nice if the company would take care of this before someone arrives if the property has been sitting empty, especially for the cost. I'm glad it worked out well so we didn't have to scramble for a new stay while dealing with wedding stuff as well.

All in all we really enjoyed our stay. The house is beautiful and mostly worth it. If you have people with you with mobility issues, it may not work out or put them on the top floor to minimize going up and down. I would also encourage you to contact the rental company to inquire about anyone staying there and see if they can help you with the stench of the water. For the price and the fact it's vacation, renters shouldn't be left to deal with such a disgusting, pungent smell.",Stairs

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

There was a paddle board and two kayaks to use as well as several water toys for children and adults. We didn't use the pool due to the weather but it was kept very clean.

I had a night cough, so we used both bedrooms and the smaller one seamed to have some type of lingering order we couldn't identify.

The grounds were beautiful and the trail to the beach areas easy to follow. Everything in the description of the property was accurate and we used the beach chairs several times.

The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

Our host from the onset was very communicative and quick to respond. The apartment had been cleaned early and she reached out to let us know we could check in early even though we didn't ask for it so that was a nice touch, pity we weren't in town yet. 

The apartment was accurate according to the listing and nothing was not a surprise to us which is always nice.

I would say that if you are a tall person (6' 3""), like myself, I would just be a little wary as the ceilings are lower than usual apartments. The issue really wasn't the ceiling in my case, it was the door frames. I banged my head a couple of times not thinking but it was not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.

The bathroom was clean and had plenty of body wash, shampoo and conditioner which was nice to have. 

I would recommend the host to add aluminum foil in the apartment because one day we made frozen pizzas in the oven and as the tray provided had gaps in it we had a little bit of a crumb cleanup because it was impossible to prevent crumbs falling through. 

Parking at the property was very convenient with a caveat. Parking is in the alley way where it's super tight. With a passenger van it's a tight squeeze and you have to be super careful not to not anything. 

Overall, it was a great stay hence the 5 star rating. Thank you for a lovely stay. Would certainly recommend to anyone.",Injury

There were some things that need improvement. The location in proximity to stores and disney world parks is perfect. It is a little farther from the pool area than we usually prefer. This is a very large complex.
They did provide a pack n play and kids dishes which was great. However there is not 1 single pan to be used in the oven. This house has 5 bedrooms with atleast 1 themed for children, children who typically love fries and chicken nuggets, we need a baking pan.
Also, the kitchen table and coffee table are not kid friendly. They are glass with pointy corners.
The kitchen table has a sharp metal piece on the under side that I cut my leg on twice, we then put a bandaid over the metal.
There are lots of dirt and markings over the walls, not a game changer but aesthically displeasing.
There are a few light bulbs that need to be changed. The lights would turn on and then flicker off after 20 minutes. 
The pool table sticks had broken tips.
The most annoying thing about staying here is that there is terrible cell service so wifi is a necessity. Well the wifi did not work for the first 3 days. I was able to contact someone when we left the house but then did not receive the response until the next day due to no service. When the company came to fix it they told us it's known that cell service here is terrible. 
Since we stayed here for our disney vacation I had to get up early to go to Starbucks down the rode 3 mornings in a row to book genie +, this was highly frustrating.

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep.

It was mainly my husband and I who stayed here but the other rooms were used off-and-on by our adult children and grandkids. All the beds were very comfortable, and we were happy to use the portable playpen for the new baby and the toys and books for the 3-year-old.

There was no carpet and no stairs - which worked fantastic for my blind dog and my husband, who dislocated his ankle and broke his fibula shortly after arriving in Missoula. So if you are looking for an easy-to-maneuver house, this one will work great! :-)

The only suggestions for improvement is that the couch, although a perfect fit for the living room, definitely should be updated (owner said this is planned for spring), and the neighbors, while friendly, did not shovel the driveway as planned every time it snowed. In Missoula, snow tends to melt on the driveway within a couple of days anyway, but with my husband in a boot and on a scooter, he was not able to shovel the driveway himself so sometimes it was snow-packed for a few days.

View was beautiful from the dining and living room, as well as the kitchen. The rest of the house furniture wise was a little dated but comfortable. This house is about a 2 minute drive to the ski lodge at appalachian ski mountain where our children were taking ski lessons this weekend. 

Our main issue for the house was its exterior condition. This house is located close to the top of the Appalachian mountain Ski resort which is often blowing snow, and some of that snow may blow back on the property. In addition, it had snowed a few days prior. When we arrived, the driveway was not plowed, and with the temps jumping above and below 32 degrees it quickly became very slick. We could not pull one of our cars out of the driveway as a result, and the walkway to the entrance was also covered in snow and became pretty slick (one of our members slipped on the way in). The next day one of us had to shovel and salt the driveway ourself to give a chance for our subaru to make it out. 

On top of this, the thermostat was set to 50 degrees when we arrived, and took overnight to warm up the whole house to 70. We had to keep our 2, 4, and 6 year old in their jackets the rest of the evening to keep them warm. My father in law also tried calling the number provided for the owner but never received a call back. 

When I contacted the owner via the vrbo app they indicated that it is hard to keep up with the snow at all times, and so the driveway and walkway may not be cleaned. They also said that they control the heat remotely via wifi so that perhaps there was a connection issue. 

Regardless, for folks who are making decisions in the future on where to stay, just note that these may be things that you might have to deal with after arrival during the winter season. Had we known that we would have to clean the driveway, we would have saved the expense and just stayed in a hotel.",Accommodation

There was even some mold around the ceiling vents. The carpeting was stained and worn down. Cosmetically it was outdated…. Furniture was mismatched and didn’t fit the space well. 

One evening when I was getting into bed, I even noticed blood stains on the pillow (not on the pillow case, but on the pillow itself). To be clear, these did not come from me. When I went to swap it out for an extra that was in the closet, all of those were full of stains and what appeared to be mold.

Points positifs : Idéalement situé proche de tout. Accueil à l’hôtel juste à côté. Propriétaire très réactif s’il y a un problème. Pièce de vie très agréable
Bon à savoir : 2e étage sans ascenseur, 1 chbre single (6m2) et 1 alcôve (6,5m2) fermée par une porte coulissante accueillant 2 lits simples sans aucun rangement ni fenêtre.
A mon avis pour 3 adultes maximum ou 2 adultes + enfants.
Points négatifs : Petites choses pas très graves devraient être améliorée rapidement. 
Toilettes : lunette cassée, pas de brosse wc (brosse cuisine ?)
Salle d’eau : une ampoule qui marche par intermittence, pas de lumière sur la glace impossible de se maquiller. Tapis de sortie de douche à changer. 
Cuisine : trop peu de verre (3) les 2 autres pas stables sur la table (verre Coupe du monde Qatar), manque écumoire et louche et aussi des ustensiles en plastique (cuillère en bois source de bactéries), les deux grandes poêles sont à changer. Manque couvercle à la poubelle

Die Unterkunft ist rustikal, es wird vermutlich eine ehemalige Jagdhütte sein, welche mit vielen authentischen entsprechenden Dekorationen auszuwerten weiß. Man ist nah am Nationalpark, ein Auto ist aber definitiv für fast alle Ausflüge notwendig.

Das Haus besteht aus einen Vorraum und Wohnzimmer mit Kamin in der unteren Etage. Vom Wohnzimmer geht eine mittelsteile Treppe hinauf in einem zweiten Wohn-Essraum. Dort befinden sich ebenso Toilette (einfach aber wie alles sehr sauber), eine Küche und die beiden Schlafzimmer. Geschlafen haben wir sehr gut, die Bettwäsche war sauber und der Jahreszeit entsprechend dick. Die Küche bietet tatsächlich nur das nötigste und ist wie auf den Bildern zu sehen, sehr klein. Wir waren zu viert (davon zwei Kinder) und konnten uns arrangieren. Mit mehreren Erwachsenen wird es wohl etwas eng.

Wissen sollte man, dass bei der Schnee der Aufstieg zum Haus mühsam ist. Besonders mit Kleinkind/Baby oder Gepäck. Der Weg zur Hütte (ca 50-80 Meter) wird nicht geräumt (!) und ist einen Hang hinauf. Bei Schnee war es z.T. sehr schwierig oder man hat Spaß am Schneeschippen ;) . Auch der Parkplatz wurde bei unserem Aufenthalt max einmal am Tag geräumt. Manchmal auch nicht,sodass an der Kirche (ca 1,2 Km entfernt) geparkt. werden musste. Das ist aber sicherlich nur ein Winterproblem. Das vorbestellte Babybett haben wir nicht bekommen, die Heizung im Wohnzimmer war ab Tag zwei leider kalt (Luft in der Heizung, wurde uns jedoch erst bei Abfahrt erklärt). Oben war es aber jederzeit schön warm und dort auch unser Aufenthaltsort. Wir haben uns dann abends den Kamin angemacht. 

Bei einem Aufenthalt mit Kleinkind, Baby stellt die Treppe eine große Gefahr da. Sie ist sehr offen und direkt am Küchentisch. Hier wäre eine Babysperre sehr hilfreich.

Im Ganzen haben wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können einen Urlaub hier empfehlen.",Accommodation

You are paying for location, not quality of accommodations. Of note, this is unit #9 in the condo block. This is not listed in the check-in details and you will be left wandering around peering in windows trying to find the art that matches the listing photos until the manager calls you back. The only hint we got that we were in unit 9 was the name of the wifi network. 

There were three main issues with this property. 
1. The garage door was broken and we had to manage a service call while we were there (they fixed it in a haphazard way that required a light switch to be on in order to operate the door)
2. The dryer was broken. We were instructed that the dry mountain air is great for hang-drying. Fine, but for a week and 6 people we just had laundry hanging everywhere the entire time.  3. The management company said they had a cable person coming for a routine service, but asked us if we’d like to decline the visit. We said we’d like to decline and went on with our ski day. Later in the day I find out my mom was in the bathroom when a stranger let themselves into the house. After being super freaked out she learns it is the cable person. When pressed, the person said they used the code and let themselves in. In our opinion this was unacceptable and raises safety and security concerns. When we asked the management company to respond, they stopped responding to my messages and didn’t contact us again until they sent an automated check out message.

We’re reasonable renters and don’t expect perfection. We understand issues arise when you are staying in someone else’s home, but the combination of these three things (given the price of the rental) just amounted to too many problems and I was really disappointed that the management company ghosted us when I asked for a response. 

Pros:
3 minute walk to the poma t-bar. Location is excellent
Large mudroom where you can leave your skis and poles
Spacious bedrooms each with their own bathroom
Apple TV makes casting/music easy

Cons: 
Broken drier
Broken garage door
Unplowed driveway (they didn’t plow after a few snows and now it is just a compacted snow mess that is really challenging to drive over and treacherous to walk on)

A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them.

I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs earlier if it was allowed. They said yes, one hour no problem and 2 hours yes for $50 each of those hours.

I notified the property manager Joanne about the smell expecting a solution (you know, cleaning or fragrances) and it's really hard to believe but Joanne's solution was for me to leave! If it sounds crazy, it is. Now you might think I did something wrong or I was rude, or demanding, I didn't. I have the entire transcript, happy to send along if you can find me via email. I asked her for a change of sheets as well, but she only had one set (for the week with no washer) and I informed her the toilets she had serviced still weren't working correctly. That was just too much. I think this is a sufficient property as long as you don't need anything of the property manager/don't mind off smells. This the wildest stay I've ever had. You know how it is with narcissism, criticism isn't handled very well. Long story short, I was evicted after asking about the smell. Also, be warned, next door is a burned out townhouse with broken windows and full of trash from a fire that killed the tenant. A sketchy view from the king bedroom window.

You might be better off staying somewhere on Washington St or in Harpers Ferry.

This property was advertised as a two bedroom. It is NOT. It is a studio apartment with a bed and a futon in the kitchen. 
Upon arrival my family and I came to a parking area and this stay is located in the back building behind a car park, a bit sketchy and uneasy feeling. Upon entry, the hallway leading to the apartment was wide open, and mailboxes were broken and smashed in. We get to our door and the lock box barely worked. Entering, everything looked ok, further settling in and checking out the space, the window was left open, dust everywhere, broken cabinets, entry way door frame broken scratched as though someone had attempted breaking in.

The bathroom photographed in these photos is not the layout of the actual bathroom we had. 
The faucet for said bathroom was also broken. Upon booking in Oct when I wrote to the host, he never got back to me. Upon arrival, it took VRBO and myself several attempts to reach the owner and they did not respond to any of my messages until after the remainder of payment was made.

To may dismay their attempt to rectify the situation by giving them a day to ""change the sheets""...... the one with blood and pubic hair on them....

We decided not to stay because of the unsanitary practices of listing and misrepresentation of the listing, and because as a guest I believe that their resolution was unsatisfactory. 
We were advised by VRBO that we could not cancel since we arrived at the location and it was up to the owner to decide whether or not they wanted to refund our money.... you can see where this is going. Even though I wanted to cancel the reservation the DAY OF arrival.

A spatula had cooked egg on it. 2 blue throw pillows placed on top of made bed had human fluid looking substance dried on them. I photographed these, the dents on the fridge and chewed corners on stairs so they wouldn’t be blamed on my pets or us. We were only 2 people and our 2 well behaved dogs.

They offered to take care of the pillows and dirty dishes but I told them “no worries” that I would put the pillows in a closet and probably not go upstairs, where the bed with the dirty pillows was. There was a record snowfall so we spent a lot of time indoors on the first of 2 full booked days. After a good night’s sleep and with fresh eyes we wanted to sit and watch the snow fall in front of the fireplace. The fireplace was broken. We pulled open the curtains to reveal large stickers warning that there was broken glass that needed to be replaced. Now we looked further around the house for places to relax as that was the option at this point. There was dirt in almost every corner, up the stairs etc. the chandelier above the cooktop in the island was coated in the layer of old dust on grease seen in dirty restaurants I’ve inspected . There was dripped food on the fronts of cabinets. There were no bath towels in the upstairs. I had called to ask how to check in as the email had gone to spam. This was the day prior to arrival. I asked if early check in was possible so I would leave the Colorado Springs hotel earlier if it was allowed. They said one hour early- no problem and 2 hours yes for an hourly fee.. Since it actually came to over five racks for the 3 nights (2 days) another few bucks for 2 hours earlier off the road and out of prior hotel was no problem to me. After spending the first whole day seeing how dirty the place was we decided to leave a day early. I texted that we were leaving but got no reply. 12 hours later we got a text asking if we were clear on how to check out. Argumentative",Window

Old tile flooring in the 2 bedrooms on the main floor. Cracks on the walls. The basement is completely unfinished with old worn leather couch and old cushion couches.

First, we did not receive the code for entry of the house. I had to call the management company (AMI) when we arrived. Not a great start. Upon entry, we discovered the water was turned off. Although I understand this is probably not a recurring issue with this house, this was unacceptable. The water was off for 24 hours before it was finally restored. AMI handled this issue as quickly as they could.

When we arrived, the handle to the kitchen sink was completely broken off. I fixed it myself. The elevator was not working, so we had to haul every bin and bag we had up the stairs (and you’re talking, like, 20 foot levels).

The pool was “working” but the lights as well as the waterfall jets were not. This needs to be fixed as the lights at night would be nice and probably a bit safer. The listing says the pool is serviced twice a week: not true. Not a single person came to service or clean the pool the entire time we were there and we had to contact the management company three times to get someone to come out and finally look at it. A tech came who had no clue how to fix it BUT they did leave the hose in the pool, blasting water for over four hours before we noticed it was overflowing and finally realizing the hose was running. 

NONE of the TVs worked when we got there. AMI said someone would come out. I figured out what was wrong myself before the tech came many days later. 

VERY unhappy about the $120+tax “damage fee” they charge. Apparently this is non-refundable. If AMI/VRBO charges every guest a damage fee before setting foot on the property, EVERYTHING should be in working order. What am I paying this for, exactly? Stay here at your own risk. There is a guestbook in the living room where everyone signs and tells a little about their stay. We are not the first to have issues here… Although the location of the property is unbeatable and many other aspects of this property are nice, this property has a long history of broken things. (This includes windows that were also still broken when we stayed there) We are not the exception when it comes to these issues.

The good:

The backyard pool area is nice and secluded with excellent landscaping. The rooftop deck has the best views of both the harbor and the ocean. The sunsets are great. All the patios are great. Having beach cruiser bikes in the garage was nice as well.

Good luck!",Window

I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water. Owner had a lot of spices and, thankfully, a full box of table salt we used on the steps.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

One of the main reasons for choosing the Cottage, given my brother-in-law is disabled, was the fact that there were no steps to be negotiated and the accommodation was all on one floor with each bedroom having an en-suite shower room. However, it was disappointing to discover that there were no grab handles in either shower room, which given that the word “accessible” is used in the description was somewhat puzzling.

We really liked the layout of the accommodation and the property is very inviting and comfortable. Unfortunately, the claim that there was a “fully stocked kitchen” turned out to be woefully untrue. Just by way of establishing some credibility we successfully ran 3 self-catering properties, 2 of which were in France and one in Dorset, for several years. Since all 3 properties had a dishwasher, then as is normal practice we provided double the quantity of crockery, glassware, cutlery etc. This property was supposed to house 6 people but there was not even 6 of everything, let alone 12! There were significant omissions too, the most alarming one being the lack of a coffee maker and a cafetière. Most places we visit these days has a Nespresso or similar coffee maker. There was also no teapot.
 
If we were being unkind then we could assume that the reason for the lack lustre approach to equipping the kitchen was meant to encourage guests to use the restaurant and that the self catering part of the business is a low priority compared with weddings, corporate events, hotel and restaurant. Clearly, we do not know how well the other properties are equipped, but what a shame that the wonderful renovation work has been undone by something which would be so easy to remedy.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people
Excellent customer service - fans provided within hours after contacting the manager.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing.

A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other!

It was exactly as described in the listing and so much more! There is so much to experience on property making it extremely difficult to depart. From the large theater room with surround sound and plush leather recliners to the fully equipped karaoke studio offering online access to all your favorite tunes, this home has it ALL! Whether it's gaming, shooting a game of pool or engaging in a one on one ping pong challenge championship, there's never a shortage of activities and something for everyone! 
And if romance is what you crave... I highly recommend pouring yourself a cocktail at sunset before slipping into the most deliciously positioned and well maintained hot tub! While gazing upon Lake Candlewood, you'll enjoy a front row seat to a stage honoring clear skies and dancing constellations! 
It seems your host, Peter, thought of every meticulous detail making this home a recipe for perfection! 
The kitchen is fully equipped for entertaining and creating a masterful feast, and the outdoor spaces make it nothing short of priceless for family gatherings and reunions! Additionally, the home feels like a 5-Star boutique resort! It's tidy, clean, and well maintained. I myself prioritize a good night's rest while on vacation and I must say, without hesitation that the master suite most certainly offers a such an experience with a king size bed not soon forgotten! And, no worries... food and spirit provisions are only minutes away, and if the detailed instructional guides lack the answers you seek, Peter is a phone call away! 
He was a ""rock star"" host and available when needed.

He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often. 

Next day we noticed the bathroom in the room on the right has no power outlet. Ironically, there is a hair dryer though.
The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far). 
Got home after a long day and ran to the bathroom (long shuttle ride) just to slip on a pool of water and dislocate my knee! Water was dripping out of the back of the toilet tank. I turned off the water and called/texted management for help. No one even responded until the next day!

Just by way of establishing some credibility we successfully ran 3 self-catering properties, 2 of which were in France and one in Dorset, for several years. Since all 3 properties had a dishwasher, then as is normal practice we provided double the quantity of crockery, glassware, cutlery etc. This property was supposed to house 6 people but there was not even 6 of everything, let alone 12! There were significant omissions too, the most alarming one being the lack of a coffee maker and a cafetière. Most places we visit these days has a Nespresso or similar coffee maker. There was also no teapot.
 
If we were being unkind then we could assume that the reason for the lack lustre approach to equipping the kitchen was meant to encourage guests to use the restaurant and that the self catering part of the business is a low priority compared with weddings, corporate events, hotel and restaurant. Clearly, we do not know how well the other properties are equipped, but what a shame that the wonderful renovation work has been undone by something which would be so easy to remedy.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

A VRBO home is supposed to be a home away from home, however, it was difficult to make this claim due to multiple issues encountered with the house that is this particular VRBO home, specifically w/ issues of safety, cleanliness, and amenities provided (or, amenities the VRBO home listing claimed to have provided). It is unacceptable that we had to drive hours home and make multiple trips to the store – when we are already staying at a “home away from home” which, in essence, states it provides these items – in order to grab items such as additional chairs, laundry detergent, salt, pans, etc, as well as in order to clean house, launder sheets; continually be aware of any safety issues to prevent injury; and having to use broken and malfunctioning items, when we paid a significant amount to spend our annual family vacation at this house. 
Issues with safety: 
Baby gate malfunctioning/broken: one-year-old had to be constantly monitored in order to not fall down a flight of stairs, instead of family being able to relax and let children run and play safely
Sofa couch in master bedroom broken: this was a sleeping location for one of the kids, and the fact the a child was not safe to sleep on this is a major safety issue
Barn doors’ locking mechanisms broken on both doors of bathrooms: doors opening when people in bathroom/getting out of showers, with no way to lock doors, and doors not large enough to cover both ends/both cracks of the sides of the bathroom entrance fully, therefore, doors have to be constantly watched in order for anyone to go to the bathroom in peace
Master bathroom shower (downstairs) leaking constantly 
Broken trash can in kitchen – lid broken off and not functional
Issues with cleanliness: 
Dirty sheets on ALL beds: peed-on blankets in upstairs master bedroom specifically, dirty stained sheets in bunk room on both beds, dog hair on all/most beds in entire house
We had to go and purchase laundry detergent in order to wash all sheets prior to being able to even sleep on them
All couches with dirty covers, dog hair everywhere
Floors dirty in kitchen and living room, surfaces dirty
We had to buy disinfectant/Clorox wipes in order to clean surfaces prior to using
The trash bins outside were full from previous guests’ usage, upon our arrival, so we had no room to dispose of our trash
Issues with amenities provided: 
No grill – we had bought food and planned on grilling it, and were unable to, despite the fact that the listing specifically stated there is a grill
No twin bed in bunk room – needed this for one of the children, however, there is no twin bed listed, despite this being included in the list of amenities
No laundry detergent – unable to wash the dirty sheets in the bedrooms or the dirty covers off of the couches (there was about a ¼ cup laundry detergent left upon our arrival; this was used up immediately)
No extra sheets – see comment on dirty sheets above 
No extra blankets
No extra towels – not even enough towels (4 adults showering in upstairs bathroom, with the broken barn door, however only 6 bath towels…in all, for 4 adults x 5 days, even though listing states it sleeps 15) 
Not enough forks – only 10 provided, and we had to wash them multiple times a day in order to have enough silverware for our group for each meal
No salt (despite listing stating “Pantry Items” included)
No toaster – we had specifically counted on toasting breakfast items as well 
Only 8 chairs – listing states “sleeps 15”, however there is only enough chairs to sit 8 people.
Had to go home, couple hours away, in order to get more chairs for our group (which was less than 15 people) 
Overall, the house appears to not have been ready for a group of more than 8 people, or for any group desiring to stay in a clean home away from home, one that is without safety hazards and issues, and one that provides enough basic amenities for all guests to use the house comfortably (the number of guests the house states to be able to “sleep”/provide for). The fact that the house has an exorbitant $3,000 damage fee and a cleaning fee of $225, is highly inappropriate considering the fact that the house was already with multiple malfunctioning, broken, and unsafe necessities/issues and the fact that our group had to clean the house and launder the sheets on the beds prior to being able to even use them. Our group WAS the cleaning crew, and we WERE safety inspection crew – constantly watching for baby to not fall down stairs or for bathroom doors to not slide open during bathroom use or to hit a child due to sliding at will and not being able to lock into place – so it is unclear what we are paying for. 
Our family and group has been renting a VRBO/Airbnb annually for many, many years, and never have we encountered such a lackluster and negative experience on so many fronts. 
TL,DR: 
Positive: the house is aesthetically pleasing and is decorated well – including having a Christmas tree in the living room, as we were at this VRBO home in late December. The location was very beautiful and close to sightseeing and activities in the multiple cities around.
Negatives: house was not clean, sheets and blankets and couch covers dirty/with dog hair/peed on, numerous broken items/safety issues, and lack of promised and listed amenities. Due to this, and us having to function as cleaning crew and safety inspection crew, it was difficult to relax or enjoy our stay here, and, unfortunately, we would not recommend this VRBO rental to anyone.",Accommodation - Slippery Surfaces

There was a 4-5"" snow a few days after we got there. The condo had no ice melt, kitty litter, or sand to put out. There was no shovel and not even a broom. The temperature was in the 20s most of our stay. A few days later, an ice storm hit with about 4"" of ice pellets falling in sheets for about 30 hours. We were completely stranded inside the condo and had nothing but breakfast cereals to eat as we had planned on eating at our daughter's house on another lake or eating out. The garbage truck did not run the whole last week and the bin was so full the lid wouldn't shut when we left. We got so desperate that I used a cookie sheet to clear the steps so we could get out to the sidewalk. The bath linens were worn out, some badly stained, and all faded. The bath rugs had no backing so they slipped out from under our feet daily. Two of us are disabled. One hit the floor while trying to stand from the toilet when the rug her feet was on slid away. I nearly fell twice just trying to step out of the shower, but the floor was even slicker. Rugs are definitely needed with rubber backing. Some previous person had broken the door jamb off the front door that held the chain lock. Someone had tried to repair it with hot glue and a few short nails. I could stick all 4 fingers under the board because it was not repaired correctly. As a result, the chain lock was worthless. The neighbor in unit 67 made so much noise between midnight and 1:00 a.m. that my husband or I was up every night concerned our vehicle or something else was being damaged. We checked the parking lot repeatedly because the noise sounded like it was coming against our walls and/or outside. This unit needs a lot of routine repairs. At least one electrical outlet by the couch did not work. The kitchen sink light is in an open hole in the ceiling. Several places had some type outlet loosely hanging from the walls. The door frames into the kitchen were dirty. We had to buy toilet paper because what was supplied was so rough that my skin was bleeding by day two! The outside especially needs painting as the exposed wood is deteriorating in many places. Frankly, the whole unit needs a lot of basic upkeep. The parking lot is extremely uneven which was very dangerous when covered in ice. Fortunately, the heating was excellent and the beds were okay. We had plenty of hot water.

Minuses: Biggest issues were communication. We asked for up front if they’d consider renting to us with our 2 under 30# dogs. “Yes, that’s fine” they told us in writing. Later in month, owner accused us of bringing dogs which were expressly prohibited. Then, we asked for one additional day on our rental 6 days before end of month. A day before we were to check out, owners send me texts saying we were supposed to be out today by 11am & the cleaning lady was waiting at the door to get in. After a few texts back & forth & repeated requests to them to check our communication on the VRBO site to confirm they approved a 1 day extension. Just as with the dog matter, they said yes, we were right. Giving us fits on both issues! I believe there are 2 or more people running this rental and they aren’t communicating with each other! We left the place in fine shape. Never had owner issues with other VRBO owners. Other issues: no coffee filters for coffee pot, no foil, plastic wrap, baggies or food storage containers.

It was exactly as described in the listing and so much more! There is so much to experience on property making it extremely difficult to depart. From the large theater room with surround sound and plush leather recliners to the fully equipped karaoke studio offering online access to all your favorite tunes, this home has it ALL! Whether it's gaming, shooting a game of pool or engaging in a one on one ping pong challenge championship, there's never a shortage of activities and something for everyone! 
And if romance is what you crave... I highly recommend pouring yourself a cocktail at sunset before slipping into the most deliciously positioned and well maintained hot tub! While gazing upon Lake Candlewood, you'll enjoy a front row seat to a stage honoring clear skies and dancing constellations! 
It seems your host, Peter, thought of every meticulous detail making this home a recipe for perfection! 
The kitchen is fully equipped for entertaining and creating a masterful feast, and the outdoor spaces make it nothing short of priceless for family gatherings and reunions! Additionally, the home feels like a 5-Star boutique resort! It's tidy, clean, and well maintained. I myself prioritize a good night's rest while on vacation and I must say, without hesitation that the master suite most certainly offers a such an experience with a king size bed not soon forgotten! And, no worries... food and spirit provisions are only minutes away, and if the detailed instructional guides lack the answers you seek, Peter is a phone call away!

He advised us that “these break all the time.” We selected this property to be able to sit on the patio by the fire. They should be checking things like this before guests arrive, especially since they break so often.

The map location shows the cabin is directly in the center of town, but it’s actually about 11 miles away from where the map shows. Since Uber isn’t available in the area, getting to/from town cost us a $15/person shuttle ride (usually $10 but cabin is EXTRA far).

False advertising (no working fireplace for heat), broken/smashed small and large appliances (we took pictures and sent the to Vacasa), poor customer service (unresponsive and offshore call center), broken items crammed in closets) all made for a poor rental experience. The Tyra condo HOA, Vail Resorts, the town of Breckenridge, Summit County, and the State of Colorado should consider investigating Vacasa and possibly VRBO for potential criminal safety and false advertising violations.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard!

We tried everything and couldn’t fix it… So again called the owner and she said her parents had went to turn the hot water off so the pipes wouldn’t freeze a few months ago.. (she failed to inform us of this before check in) she also said they had put antifreeze in toilets so the water wouldn’t freeze (what in the world???) she said she would call the plumber in the morning… so that night we had no hot water and had to boil some water for the kids to take a bath.

This property had a lot of positives. The location was nice. Good neighborhood. Garage parking. Full washer and dryer. Wall A/C units. Plenty of space. Great views. Host communicated all requirements clearly and in a timely manner.

It also had some issues. Spiderwebs on just about every ceiling, with spiders. I had to kill and clear one above the master bed before we could sleep. The house gives off an “unfinished” vibe. There are open holes/outlets with wires sticking out. Like there used to be a tv or sound system wired, but it’s a lot of wires. One of the water faucets, the top came off if you pulled on it to turn on the water. All of this added up to a very cheap feeling for the house and I felt not worth the money. I paid $730 NZD/night.

The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them.

Check in was smooth at the office in central Malaga where we were allowed to store our luggage until 4pm.

The apartment was clean & the large balcony became an afternoon sun trap after midday during February.
Beds were firm & comfortable & showers plentiful with good pressure & hot water. Air conditioning/ heating kept most rooms warm when the temperatures dropped in the evenings.

Location was everything: Quiet & although the apartment is about 2.75k from central Malaga we loved the walk along the seafront. Bus services the regular (No’s 40 & 7). Running & scooter rides along the front really made the break. 
Plenty of excellent local restaurants within 5 minutes walk of the apartment negating the need to go into central Malaga. Particularly liked La Mafia, Terra Mia and Taco Box.

Some not so positives in our experience were:

- No hand wash in bathrooms or kitchen ( important post Covid I would have thought) rather than tiny soaps.
- No plugs in the bathrooms/ kitchen - difficult to have a quick wash or clean plates & cups in the kitchen.
- Kettle was very small & difficult to use. Looked unsafe (electric wiring exposed) & hot steam vented on to your hand when pouring.",Electrical - Loose or exposed wiring

The location of this unit is excellent. It’s super close to the slopes and we had a good view from the balcony to see our kids going down the slope. It was right next to the laundry room too, which was really convenient. There was a good selection of cookware and dishes in the unit, as well as a blender and a crockpot. The weren’t very many spoons/forks but we brought our own plasticware and disposable cups/plates/bowls so we were set. The listing indicated there was a Keurig, but there was not - there was a Mr. Coffee brewer so the k-cups we brought with us were useless. 

I’ve never stayed at any of the other condos in this complex so I cannot say how this one compares to the others, I can only share my experience/observations. 

Between beds, bunks and a pullout sofa, it slept eight. There was only enough seating for four people unless you used the barstools. The beds weren’t terrible, but they weren’t great either. Probably depends on what you’re used to. I’m told the bunks slept terrible. 

First thing we noticed when we arrived was the smoke alarm just inside the entry was hanging by wires and was covered with a plastic bag. Having no idea what was going on, we left it as it was. In addition to that, the toilet in main bath was shimmed on one side and didn’t appear to be properly attached to the floor, as it sometimes lifted off floor if you moved a certain way while using it. There was nowhere to hang a hand towel in the bathroom and you could see where a towel bar once hung. The tub did not drain well at all and each shower meant standing in ankle deep water. The bathroom door had a terrible squeak and sleeping in the adjacent room was rough as each time someone visited the bathroom there was no sleeping through it. This experience was shared by those sleeping in bunk room. In the kitchen the refrigerator door would not shut without a good push. The microwave oven quit working our last morning there. Can’t count that as a negative really because those things happen. The small dryer in the bunk room ran but did not dry. The air was cool. 

There were no real checkout instructions so we followed same etiquette we would if staying at a hotel. All dishes were washed and put away and all trash was taken to dumpster. We did not vacuum, mop, wash/change bed linens or sanitize. We did however pay a $125 cleaning fee. 

Two days after we left, the owner of the unit began repeatedly calling one of my children’s phone and leaving very aggressive sounding messages demanding a return call. Based on that, I was not comfortable talking to him so he left me a message on Vrbo instead. He said the condo was left in bad condition - probably the worst he’d ever seen. And that the microwave was broken and he was charging me the $250 security deposit. I told him about the things I’ve noted in this review - that the condo was in bad condition when we arrived and we left nothing was out of place, no dirty dishes, no trash. We handled everything except what we assumed cleaning fee covered and there was nothing in the listing to specify we should have done anything differently. I think the broken microwave was the crux of the issue. I’ve replaced several microwaves in my home over the years. They quit working sometimes, but I got the distinct feeling I was being held responsible for that and thus the threat to be charged. In the end he decided not to charge the $250. 

My advice to anyone staying here or anywhere else is to know upfront what the owner expects, what the cleaning fee covers, and take notes/photos of issues observed when you arrive and take photos as you leave. 

Based on my experience with this particular unit after our stay, I would not stay again.",Electrical - Loose or exposed wiring

It is huge, beautifully decorated, and well stocked. Those complaining about having to supply certain items obviously do not stay in villas very often. The pool was great, warm and tons of fun for the kids. We brought our own pool toys and games and threw them away prior to departure. Loved the room set up, location of the house, community security, etc. We take 1-2 trips to Florida each year. It’s been our family tradition for over 18 years and we always rent villas. This was our first rental with Blue Skies and I must say, I was impressed with their policies, how communicative/responsive they were (love the text feature!). Challenges with the house: when we arrived, at check in, the cleaners were still inside cleaning. No biggie, but we had been waiting at the clubhouse for HOURS and were ready to settle in. The house was clean, but there was a bandaid in the pool (we scooped it out with the net), the projector was broken (was a bummer but we didn’t care enough to contact the management company, there is soooo many other things to do! Like splash in the pool!!), and to our horror, there is seemingly a roach infestation. There are large size water bugs or cockroaches in the upstairs area (mainly saw in the master bedroom and laundry room), but there are what seem to be German (??) cockroaches that have infested the kitchen area. The first one we saw was dead in the master bedroom on the main level, but then we started seeing them throughout the kitchen. Drawers, on the stove, cabinets, and hiding in dishwasher. We bought raid, and lots of Lysol spray and wipes, but knew it wasn’t the solve. I contacted management and they sent an exterminator IMMEDIATELY, which was appreciated, but didn’t solve the issue either. I am not quite sure why there is a possible infestation because the house is CLEAN. The only thing I can think is because the fridge is leaking water from the freezer or whatever the water source is and perhaps that draws them? Not sure. But other than that, the house was great. We did wash all of our clothes in hot soapy water the night before we left, folded, and placed IMMEDIATELY in our LYSOLED suitcases and placed DIRECTLY in the rental van to ensure we didn’t bring any unwanted guests/hitchhikers home with us. All that said, I would rent from Blue Skies again, just maybe not this house. Which is shameful because it’s BEAUTIFUL.

While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and that Unit-6 had no Wi-Fi ! Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote. Later learned that Unit 5 has unlimited Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.

The property is great and Napili bay is wonderful (be careful of rip currents and pay attention to the red flags - usually placed in front of the Sea House restaurant). Internet reception was good but not great for conference calls. I brought my own eero wifi router and after installing it, had no issues.

In itself this is not a big issue, but everyday there were maintenance people hosing off stuff right outside our window at about 6:00 AM. Also, there are parking lots on 2 1/2 sides of the building, so people driving/parking/talking at night were noticeable. Moreover, one jalousie windows in the master bedroom would not close all the way because vines had grown up into the window. I tried to move the vines out, but I couldn't get to them because the knobs that hold the screen on were rusted closed. The slightly open windows made the noise worse. Third, there is an ocean view from the living room, but it is very distant. The unit is farther from the water than any other unit and the ocean view is between two buildings.

It’s very spacious and the heated salt water pool is fantastic! I was already planning in my head a 5 star review. HOWEVER, in the middle of the night when my daughter went to use the restroom she noticed a large bug in the bathroom. None of us thought too much of this except for when the next day we came home from being gone most of the evening and my son found a roach on his backpack, and upon further searching the house there were three roaches found throughout the kitchen and also one in the master bathroom. Now we are up to SIX roaches. That is disturbing! It gets worse. Eventually a palmetto roach the size of a small mouse crawls out from underneath the couch. After we called the next day and reported the infestation someone dropped off some bug spray for us to use and said “Hey, it’s Florida and we have roaches.” 

On Sunday night I lift up the lid of the washing machine to do laundry and there is a live roach sitting on the inside lid ledge of the washing machine. 

I am having a hard time wanting to recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone else because I’m afraid they would experience the same roach problem too.

I had insomnia during our stay because I was worried about the roaches crawling into my bed. I was also concerned about possibly bringing roaches home with us in our suitcases and bags. For the price we paid, I would not expect roaches to be in this nice of a place.

While driving to the unit we received a txt message informing the access detail and the Unit had no Wi-Fi !
Wi-Fi was a main reason we chose this place. The web site did not mention NO Wi-Fi so we assumed that accommodation in this price point would be connected; ironically, there’s a TV with a Netflix remote but NO Wi-Fi!
Upon entering the unit everything looked clean and inviting, but looks can be deceptive. The unit is not dirty but its cleanliness needs much improvement. The cockroach that greeted us in the kitchen was an unwanted guest! Bathroom window and stairway ledges were grotty with dead insects. The inner pillow covers in the bedroom were slightly stained.
Strangely, many of the kitchen/bathroom drawers were open: kept springing open. 
Game changer – no aircon or fan in the bedrooms. So hot!
All accommodation we have visited previously have supplied complimentary toiletries – small soaps doesn’t meet the standard. Coffee machine but no coffee pods. Stingiest accommodation ever.
There are safety issues:
- excellent parking but the space at the side has a steep drop. This is dangerous
- entrance step to bathroom is a tripping hazard
- no shower mat – slipping hazard
- bathroom basin height is high – awkward for shorter people

It was not a good foot for our family and we would discourage those with kids under age 3 or those uncomfortable starting and maintaining a wood-burning fire from renting it.

The biggest concern we had was the heating. It was in the single digits while we were there and the main level would not get above ~62 during the morning and evening (sometimes lower). It was brutal for our infant who was crawling/walking on the floor (and us as well...we stayed in our ski jackets/pants). When we asked management if the heater was broken, we were then told to maintain heat in the house during these temperatures, we must light a fire. With a small child, this is not safe, and had we known this we would have stayed elsewhere. There was a radiator that we could use, but again, safety concern. 

The house also said it was ""stocked for full capacity."" However, there were only 5 fire starters (which we quickly used after the baby went to sleep in an attempt to warm up, but definitely wouldn't last for all day & night for a full week) and 2 shampoo and conditioner bottles (the super small ones from a hotel). So we rationed heat even more and dealt with helmet hair. 

We brought our 4W drive car with us and the snow was plowed on our street one morning, but it created a snow drift at the driveway entrance which our car got stuck on and we spent 30 minutes digging out of it. 

Although the beds state they are queens, they are the smallest queens I've ever slept on.

Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling on our second night. Dripped for about 12 hours pretty steadily. We called management right when it happened but were told they wouldn't get to it until first thing the next morning. By 9am the next morning no one was there yet and when we called they were unaware of the urgency. After talking longer, they mentioned the leak was there a few days before and it was just an ice dam on the roof that needed to be chipped off. As an owner, I would be upset about a leak not addressed more promptly. As a renter, it was really frustrating to be dealing with calling/scheduling maintenance while on vacation and sleeping with the constant ""drip drip.""

Overall, this would have been a good fit for some college or graduate students who want to pack into a house and have the freedom to be able to cook and use a fireplace and have a hot tub. However, this was not a good fit at all for a family with a small child.",Child

The space worked well for us (3 adults + 1 child). The TVs have been updated to HD flat screens. Deck reconstruction is work-in-progress. Unfortunately, we had a bad experience with high winds pushing fireplace smoke into the unit. If I came back again, I would find a different unit in Mountain Lodge without a fireplace.

More about the smell… For the first two days, there was an overwhelming, strong, unpleasant smell of fireplace smoke throughout the entire unit. The smell hit you like a wall of upon walking in the door. It made our eyes water. The smoke would be hazardous to an infant or asthmatic. There is no central HVAC (only radiant heat) so the only option to “air it out” was to open the exterior door/windows to sub-freezing high winds. We emailed the owners and they had no meaningful solutions. The building manager eventually came and she explained the wind-chimney phenomena. The phenomena is exacerbated if the units above/below use their fireplaces, which share a common chimney. The third day, mercifully, the wind died down outside and so did the smell. Our clothes stunk when we got home. It would be helpful for the owners to provide air purifiers w/HEPA filters. It smelled like we were living in a chimney.

The unit’s location in ML makes the sound from the common area of the lobby really carry into the bedrooms. If you are sensitive to noise when sleeping, find a different unit.",Child

They apologized for the inconvenience and again said a cleaner would be out shortly. Hours went by so I called again and requested to speak with a manager. The manager said a cleaner would be out shortly, but never showed. I continuously contacted Vacasa for three days until they finally sent out a cleaner to take care of the mice feces.

Do you think I dared look under a bed? I did. Do you think anyone has cleaned under there in this lifetime? They haven’t! The couch was visibly dirty from across the room.

The kitchen is the same kitchen that was there in January 2014, some 9 years ago! Same cupboards, fridge, well used and grubby utensils and utensils’ box, rusty dangerous kettle (the steam pours out of the on/off switch where your hand goes.) and a filthy waste bin area. Random grubby and useless items were in the kitchen drawers. The gas hob had one non functioning and alarming ring which we had to avoid.
We have supplied VRBO with photographic evidence of all these comments.
The site quotes “sheets, linen and towels are hotel quality”. This was not the case - bed linen was thin and of poor quality and we were expected to have the same sheets throughout our 3 week stay as no clean ones were provided until we insisted the cleaner came and unlocked the cupboard the sheets were locked in.

It was not near that. There was almost 10 space heaters plugged in throughout the home. And we had to also start the fire place and get the fire going with the wet wood they had. Due to all of the space heaters plugged in, it also blew a breaker. We found the breaker box, in the living room wall, covered with a piece of styrofoam and cloth as the breaker cover. The other breaker box had no cover. Several outlets & light switches were without covers. The outlets all had power strips or outlet extenders plugged into them.

When we first arrived in our room the things waiting for us to find were so upsetting that we would not recommend this rental. When we first arrived, I immediately notice how filthy the floor was, there was not even a smell of cleaning products to indicate it had been cleaned after the previous guests. The floor was filthy, and we ended up cleaning it ourselves. We rented this place for a two week stay. The condition of the rooms and its appliances were deplorable! The wash rags where stained black from obvious use as cleaning rags. We had to consistently ask for hand towels and wash clothes because there were not any, or they were dirty. Every touchable wall and molding were covered with grime and dirt build up. The room had constant proof of lack of upkeep and not being cleaned between guests. The windowsills had visible round rust spots and jagged edges. Several pieces of furniture had questionable white gunky substances that words couldn't describe what it even was. The sofas had spots on them of a questionable nature. One of the bar chairs were broken which wasn't noticed until we sat in the chair. The dishwasher, the first time we opened it had a mold smell and evidence of old washed food particles not removed at any point recently. The first time actually running the dishwasher had raw sewage back up into the food disposal. We requested that a plumber be sent out to fix it and the leaking washing machine that every time it ran leaked water on the floor that we were forced to clean up ourselves. The plumber said he could not fix the disposal and that it needed to be replaced, which was not installed while we were there. The electrician and plumber had been there on several occasions during our stay for one problem or another and we had to stay there when they would come out. Ruining our vacation! We stayed in constant contact with Robin addressing these issues, but it gets worse from here. The electric outlets in the kitchen were popping sparks and led to us having to plug the coffee maker and the toaster oven in the den on the floor. The dryer was so loud and not to mention dirty inside that you couldn't even hear a person talking. We did not have hot water in the shower or the sink in the kitchen for the duration of our stay. The pictures showing this rental are not what you will receive if you book here. We ended up having to move out on the seventh day because of so many electrical and plumbing issues with no quick resolve to be seen. We ended up having to book a more expensive place because this condo was not livable, nor having to constantly spend our afternoons waiting on service repairs. Renter beware this place truly needs to be gutted. All of the appliances are in disrepair. I am not sure who wrote the other three reviews, but they did not stay in this condo. It is a fire hazard and I really feel this is the most concerning of all the issues. The electrical system is definitely a fire hazard! To the point we could not sleep being concerned about it catching on fire. The list of things wrong with this condo are very long. No one should stay here.",Electrical - Faulty Equipment

We had high expectations based on the pictures of the house and our first stay. With the experience I have in the travel & tourism industry, I am used to reviewing properties. Unfortunately, Sandy Escape did not meet expectations. The following were the main issues:
 - The property was quite unclean with piles of dirt left in the downstairs bathroom. 
 - We advised there would be 10 adults staying but were only provided with 7 bath towels, even though information states bath towels are provided for all guests. 
 - Only 2 burners on the 6 burner stove work. 
 - The ice or cold water dispenser in the fridge did not work. 
 - The media/tv room on the first floor was very dirty with stains on the couch and the blinds unable to be used due to being damaged. 
 - All floors were very dirty. There is a broom but no dustpan and brush to be able to sweep up the sand/dirt.
 - Although hand soap containers were in both bathrooms and kitchen, they were empty and we needed to buy soap for them. 
 - No dishwashing liquid was provided to be able to wash dishes. 
 - They do provide dishwasher tablets for the 1 drawer dishwasher. 
 - Not enough plates or cutlery for 10 adults.

Schon nach der ersten Nacht im Haus kamen unsere beiden Kinder (9 und 5 Jahre) am Morgen mit jeweils gut 100 Stichen an Armen, Beinen und im Gesicht aus ihrem Zimmer. Sie sahen einfach nur schlimm aus! Wir hielten es zunächst für Mückenstiche, doch aufgrund der heftigen Attacke, des quälenden Juckreizes und nach weiteren Recherchen waren wir sicher, dass wir ein Problem mit Bettwanzen hatten. Ein Arzt bestätigte unseren Verdacht. 

Wir haben sofort unsere Vermieter vor Ort informiert und auch versucht, Belvilla zu kontaktieren, doch weder unter der benannten Telefonnummer noch per E-Mail war eine Kontaktaufnahme möglich. Auch EuroTours als genannte Agentur vor Ort war völlig uninteressiert und untätig.

Unser Ziel war es nun, so schnell wie möglich abzureisen - allerdings auch, den Import der Parasiten um jeden Preis zu verhindern! ALLES wurde gewaschen, in der Sonne getrocknet und in schwarzen Säcken wärmebehandelt - unser gesamtes Hab und Gut. Drei Tage haben wir in einer Notunterkunft geschlafen, die unser Vermieter vor Ort organisiert hat, und jeweils am Tag den Rückbau bewerkstelligt. Es war ein Albtraum!

Mit dem Kammerjäger haben wir uns am Tag der Abreise ‚die Klinke in die Hand gegeben‘. Völlig fertig haben wir unsere Rückreise angetreten - 1.400 km non stopp. Denn unsere Nachfolge-Unterkunft in Österreich, wo wir noch 4 Tage verbringen wollten, mussten wir auch stornieren.

Eine Recherche hat schnell gezeigt, dass es offensichtlich Strategie ist, nicht erreichbar zu sein. Über den Facebook Messenger (!) haben wir den Mangel angezeigt, dann erst hat Belvilla reagiert. Man sollte meinen, dass Belvilla einen sofortigen Handlungsbedarf sieht, um den Schaden zu regulieren, aber weit gefehlt! Hinhalten heißt die Strategie. Nach langem, zähen Hin und Her hat Belvilla ein ‚Kulanzangebot’ unterbreitet, das nicht mal dem Tagessatz einer Übernachtung entspricht. Alles mit der Begründung, dass wir nicht den sofortigen Kontakt gesucht hätten. 
Das entspricht schlicht nicht den Tatsachen und ist einfach erbärmlich. 
Achtung: Belvilla ist höchst unseriös, nie wieder! Ohne Anwalt kommt man hier nicht weiter.

Walking into the apt there was a strange smell and the bathroom smelled worse, like dirty pipes and poor ventilation for moisture. The shower wand needs to be changed, it’s so caked up with mineral buildup and mold that the stream that you get from it, is basically drops. The linoleum tiles in the bathroom are lifting because of the moisture and there was mold in the shower.

This property had a lot of positives. The location was nice. Good neighborhood. Garage parking. Full washer and dryer. Wall A/C units. Plenty of space. Great views. Host communicated all requirements clearly and in a timely manner.

It also had some issues. Spiderwebs on just about every ceiling, with spiders. I had to kill and clear one above the master bed before we could sleep. The house gives off an “unfinished” vibe. There are open holes/outlets with wires sticking out. Like there used to be a tv or sound system wired, but it’s a lot of wires. One of the water faucets, the top came off if you pulled on it to turn on the water. All of this added up to a very cheap feeling for the house and I felt not worth the money. I paid $730 NZD/night.

I’ve got no doubt that this’ll be one that fills up quickly in the future! My family and I will be on it! Three things to note:

1) If you get stuck between floors in the elevator outside of business hours, try all possible fix actions first. Then call the fire department. That emergency number that’s given to you is not a 24 hour emergency line.

2) If you want hot tub / pool heating access during your stay, communicate that ahead of time.(At least 3 days) I missed that memo and in turn missed out on the hot fun. :(

Please keep in mind the photos are from clearly years ago when the home was freshly staged, this is NOT what it looks like now. The home overall is nice but for the price point the hosts are charging for home, the house could definitely do with some maintenance and repair. I had to get the owner to get the home cleaned a second time to get it to a standard as the handover when we got there was pathetic.

When entering the house I found the following issues,
-Dirty walls, scuff marks walls in every bedroom, also the stairwell
-Dirty skirting boards
-Streaky marks all over the tiles, clearly a rushed cleaning job
-Stains on the white sofa in the living room
-Chandelier in stairwell had a blown bulb 
-Oven was filthy so was the BBQ's, they also didn't have gas bottles
-Exhaust fans and ceiling fans filthy, also smoke alarm was broken upstairs, and the laundry shoot Is broken
-Most of the house windows were dirty also covered in spider webs
-Ceilings on the outside area were dirty
-No pool towels were provided 
-All the beds were very very hard, also terrible pillows, and beds were not made properly
-Found dirty towels in the laundry upon entry
-The wheeler bins were already full when we checked in, Also had heaps of leftover recycling stacked up in the garage. The owners said they'd come and collect it but they never did. I was there for a month 

The sad part is, the home is actually in a perfect area it has so many great features but until the hosts reinvest into the up keep of the home you will be very very underwhelmed with your stay. If they do fix the issues the house would be great. So please do take care and decide carefully when booking, if these are things you can overlook then go ahead.

From the bubble lamps flanking the garage door to the gorgeous mural in the Main bthrm, this home is attractive and comfortable.

We were here in Jan 2023. The Pool is a good size approximately 14' x 40'. The heat pump kept the pool a comfy 86-88*. The handrail & stairs ensure a safe entry into a 2 1/2 ft shallow end which deepens to about 6ft.
The screen-caged lanai pool deck area is comfy with cushioned furniture & pavers that are not slippery when wet. 

The Wildlife around the Lake is beautiful. So many birds visit. (Five minutes away at Oscar Scherer State Park, there's a bird native only to Florida, the Florida Scrub-Jay!) Turtles & an alligator keep things interesting in the lake.

The lake can be enjoyed from the Kitchen, Din rm & Main Bdrm. There are ceiling fans in most rooms to keep air moving.
While most of the home has been renovated, the Kitchen needs new appliances. It has plenty of cabinets & a pantry for things renters bring.

The FamRm has a beautiful candle lit fireplace as a focal point. It has a big rug & plenty of space/shelfs for things renters bring . The sofa is extra-long and 17"" from the floor. It has book-end loungers making it look comfortable but difficult to sit on those lounge areas. Everyone faces the TV/Fireplace making it difficult to have conversations with family.

The DinRm table can be extended & has comfy upholstered chairs. It is so close to the water it's like eating at an upscale pier restaurant.

The glass, 4-chair kitch table overlooks the same 8ft of lawn & lake as the DinRm table. Tall birds more than once joined us out on the grass while we sat at the tables. *Magical.*

All three bedrooms and their closets are good sizes with space for stuff that renters bring. All mattresses are 14"" off the floor.
All bedrooms have rugs.
The King bed in the Main BdRm is medium soft foam. NO bounce. The main bthRm has a beautiful stand-alone tub, waterfall walk-in shower, waterfall double sinks & commode room. 
There is a bdrm with a Queen mattress with bounce. And a bdrm with two full size foam mattresses with bounce.
Another waterfall walk-in shower in the second bthrm.

I found the LV-Plank Flooring comfy and attractive. 
Use of the garage is good. There are beach chairs & coolers.
The upscale neighborhood is friendly. Turning R or L onto Rt41 is a challenge.

It was not safe. I was moved 2 days after being put in that place which was too long and if I had known one bit of it before I would have never booked.,Pool Safety

The worst of it was the lack of hot water in the kitchen and one of the bedroom baths . That took almost a week to fix during our 10 day stay.

The plunge pool water was cloudy when we arrived because the water level was very low; so low that it was below the skimmer pot inlet. That was fixed on day 4 of our stay.

The listing says wheel chair accessible. That was a stretch to say the least. Yes, there is an elevator (actually needed two different ones to get to our 3rd floor room with no clear direction or map from the front desk upon check-in - CONFUSING!!!) Then we discovered that there was no elevator to access the pool deck, so my wheelchair user wife had to struggle with a long stairwell up to the pool deck, using a hand rail that was rusted off the wall in two places (also finally fixed on day 4 of our stay).

Also, the raised threshold on the entry door (to keep rainwater from entering the apartment creates a challenge for any wheelchair user.

Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this property though was the complete lack of accountability or assistance from the front desk staff. It was clear after 3 or 4 attempts to solicit help from the front desk for anything (even including recommendations to local restaurants) that they were there to check you in and out and nothing more. One maddening episode occurred where a cleaning crew would not exit the elevator to allow us to take my wheelchaired spouse down to the ground floor. We had to wait 10 minutes before they completed their cleaning.

The bright spot was our Angel Host service lady, Gladys Marroquin. Though clearly overworked, she made the effort to come to the apartment on the 3rd day of our stay and got the hot water, faulty hand rail and poor pool water fixed. She even provided a free maid service to clean the apartment, change the bed sheets and have our party of 6 clothes laundered halfway through our stay as an apology for the poor maintenance. She was wonderful!

As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the property is nice. It could have been wonderful if expectations had been better set about three things:

- what “wheelchair accessible” really means at the Aldea Thai
- had maintenance been performed on the property 
- that there is no concierge service at the front desk

The bottom line was that this property disappointed us.",Pool Safety
