The power went out once during our seven day stay
TITLE: 
spectacular view and all the comforts of home
REVIEW: 
The steep trip up the mountain in our rented 4x4 was worth it as we found ourselves in a luxurious and comfy home with likely one of the most spectacular views in the area of Ojochal. Steve and April were quick to get back to us with any concerns or questions when booking and planning our trip. April went above and beyond with sending us pics of the road up to the home as I was concerned about finding the place arriving at night. Once there (which wasn’t difficult to find) Flora and Toño made our stay comfortable and homey with full hearty breakfasts each morning and kept the home comfortably clean and organized. They too answered any questions we had via google translate.
As you can imagine, we spent most of our time outside on excursions or around the luxurious poolside that included a hot tub for the cooler nights and cabana with BBQ etc for outdoor dining. Not that we needed a BBQ being minutes to Ojochal - the known foodie area of Costa Rica with a plethora of exceptional restaurants. At approx 2000’ above sea level we were comfortable enough not to need air conditioning, however they had it if we wanted it. The only thing I wish we had was screens to keep the doors and windows open at night as the cool breeze was lovely and i much prefer it over air conditioning. The power went out once during our seven day stay, but within seconds their backup generator came on, leaving the cityscape dark while our lights and amenities remained fully functioning. Although the birds, small lizards and butterflies were plentiful, we didn’t see much else, likely due to all the dogs in the area, barking at anything that would come near the property. Even though we loved the dogs, this could be a deterrent if you you don’t. If you are planning a trip to the quiet South Pacific area of Costa Rica where flora and fauna abound and want an incredible view and luxurious home with large pool area you should definitely check this home out. Would I stay at this place again? - in a heartbeat.

Location of the home was wonderful. It fit our needs. The power went out the first night we were there but Roger the property manager brought us up a cooler to put our food in until the power was turned back on which was very well appreciated. I do wish that there was some type of a fireplace access inside the home, but there was a small gas fire pit outside which was lovely and we enjoyed it every day. Overall the stay was wonderful and it was very well priced for the type of home that we had

TITLE: 
love this house!
REVIEW: 
They did SUCH a great job with this house. It’s so well decorated and READY for guests - you’ll see what I mean when you stay. Everything is labeled with directions and it truly seems like they thought of everything. 

Only issue we had was the power went out and with young kids we were nervous about it getting too cold and their milk/food spoiling. Apparently this is an issue in this area bc we heard the neighbors generator turn on immediately. Unfortunately, the generator for this house was being installed on the Monday after we left, so we didn’t have that luxury, but future renters will have backup. :) We “survived” the power outage just fine as it was restored within a couple hours. 

The kitchen is a bit smaller than it looks in photos. just a heads up that it could get a little tight in there, especially for bigger people. 

Also, the 3rd bedroom is really a loft in the upstairs office and there’s a metal spiral staircase going up. We thought this would be where my 5yo would sleep until we saw the spiral staircase. That made us nervous if he got scared or woke up in the middle of the night. Luckily, there was an air mattress with all the necessary linens that he could use instead. The loft might be ideal for kids, but probably better for older kids (middle school to college-aged, IMO). The ceiling is slanted and I don’t know if you could stand straight up there to be honest. 

All in all, it was a great place to stay. We felt comfortable in the home, it was a great location, and we’d definitely stay here again.

five star adventure
REVIEW: 
We cannot say enough about how wonderfully both the owner and the local property manager handled things during our stay during the recent “atmospheric cyclone” in Northern California. The first night, 1:29 am, to be exact, all power went out in the entire Bodega Bay area due to fallen trees and branches. The owner and manager gave us directions immediately about emergency supplies and we really appreciated the wall-outlet flashlights that lit up immediately when the power failed, We were able to light the gas stove with matches, so we had tea while we enjoyed the storm. The propane fireplace worked, as well, so we were warm and cozy. The next morning, Erika called to see how we were doing and asked the local rep to bring new flashlights and a butane lighter for the stove, The power was out for 22 hours, but we enjoyed every minute. The rest of the week was rainy, and Erika texted us each day to see how we were doing. Beds were comfy, the kitchen perfectly provisioned and the views both peaceful and spectacular, We shall return for retreats as often as possible,

TITLE: 
nice view and bedding - poor water/power/wi-fi and rocky beach
REVIEW: 
Some pros and cons:

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean

tropical paradise !
REVIEW: 
We used Nacho for Airport transfer from SJO. We would recommend that for those that have never driven in Costa Rica before. We rented a car from Uvita the next day. The roads are steep and curvy but very passable in dry season. The villa is better than the pictures can capture. We were mostly here to see the jungle and birds, wildlife etc. We were pleased with what all there is to see right from the deck. We had monkeys on the deck rail 2 out of the 7 days! Toucans, Aracaris, Tanagers, Honeycreepers, and many more other species daily. The gardener showed a sloth and its baby to us one day in a tree beside the parking area. So cool! Very friendly and helpful service personnel were there upon our arrival. We had power outages every day, but it was only out for 1 or 2 minutes a day. However, I think a back-up generator was being installed while we were there. We had a problem with the pool but Nacho and Lucie were very quick to remedy that even on a weekend. If you are looking for 1st class location and villa this will not disappoint. We would book this again without hesitation if we have the opportunity. Thank you, Lucie and Cameron, for sharing your piece of paradise with our family.

REVIEW: 
Place was awesome view. We will miss it. Just enough space for two. We elected to have joy meet us to show us how to get there. She was big help. The pool is salt and not heated. Was bummed about that. Spacious deck for both sun and shade. We were there for two weeks. Only had one day that electricity went out. Place has back up generator. But when electric goes out whole island so does wifi. So we went to beach that day. If u rent a Jeep from st Thomas and ferry over on car barge. Make sure u get on same company going back. There are more than one. And if u get on wrong one u will pay extra. Definitely need a Jeep if u are going to do any driving around island. Beaches are awesome. Trunk beach is world famous but I think I liked cinnamon beach better. They both have restrooms,showers, restaurants, drinks, souviners. Maho beach has all but showers. Those 3 beaches are best ( my opinion). U have to pay 5,00 pp at trunk bay to get in. All have small parking. So get there EARLY to park.all roads are hilly winding curves. For Some may be challenging or others fun. Gas / hot deli / grocery store mid way from Cruze bay to coral bay is good. We did a lot of driving around and packed a lunch. We had a great time and would go back. AWESOME VIEW.

REVIEW: 
The house is so large we ended up using only the second floor. Decorated eclecticly, we were constantly coming across little interesting pieces and flourishes. I won't spoil it for you. One of our favorite spots was a private dining deck open to the bay. We ate most meals there. The private beach access made entering the bay effortless and if you take a short walk along the beach before sunset you can lay on the beach and watch it sink into the Caribbean. If you're a sunrise person the Atlantic beaches are a short distance away. Also our gratitude to Mr and Mrs Williams the caretakers who greeted us on arrival answered our many questions and helped with any issues. They were efficient, friendly and genuinely great people. We had a great time and felt very comfortable. Highly recommend and are planning to return. Another plus is that the house has a generator as do their other properties, so power outages won't infringe on your good time. I could go on, but as others have said it's a very special place. Lastly we would like to thank our hosts Barbara and Luciano for being so caring and helpful. We should have stayed longer.

TITLE: 
nice property when you have electricity & water...
REVIEW: 
My family and I stayed at this property over Christmas. It is a nice house - when the power is on. A major storm came through and the power was out for 34 hours (from Dec. 23 - 10:00 pm Dec. 24). It is bad enough not to have electricity for that long (the sun went down around 4:30 pm and came up around 7:00 am), but even worse, at this house you don't have water when the electricity is out. That means that you can't flush toilets, shower, or cook. 

We got in touch with the owner about the electricity and she was responsive and communicated with local authorities about it. She kept in touch with us. We were told at least 5 times that the power would be on 'soon' but it didn't happen. 

We went to Stowe on Dec. 23 and found that many businesses had experienced a power outage also and were closed. We had no choice but to use the bathrooms at the house, even though they couldn't be flushed. We spent the night of Dec. 23 by the fire trying to keep warm and woke up on Christmas Eve hopeful that the power would be on 'soon' and we could enjoy our vacation. It didn't happen and we spent most of the day in the house with toilets full of excrement. My husband finally got some snow, melted it on the stovetop (which is gas), and put it in the toilet tanks to allow us to flush the toilets. This process literally took hours to be able to flush all four toilets. We ended up renting one hotel room (there weren't many options on Dec. 24) so my 79-year old father could sleep in a warm room and we could all take a shower and use a toilet that flushed! The owner said she would pay for the hotel room, but we had prepaid for it, and she didn't refund any of the money to our credit card.

Regarding the property itself, it is a nice, spacious house. However, furnishings are pretty outdated, some things do not work well, and the lighting is low in most rooms. For example, the shower head in the master bedroom had a hard spray that could not be adjusted, so I took my showers in the bathroom by the hot tub. The couch in the game room is uncomfortable because you slip off the cushions and the cushions don't stay in place. The game room is nice but there aren't any comfortable seats. Be aware that it is 10+ minute drive to downtown Stowe and a 20+ minute drive to the mountain. 

Would I recommend this property? IF the electricity is working, I would rate it a 4. If you stay here, pray that the electricity does not go out!

Property Manager came by, apologized and said I would be compensated. We left and went back home. I had paid for 3 nights but got one. I was only reimbursed $550 out of the $1400 I paid. I was told by the PM well the power came on at 4pm before the last night. As if we were going to go to a hotel and wait around for the power and pay for 2 locations. PGE website said the power was not coming back on until 10pm our last night so went back home. I have screenshots of the PGE website but the Vacasa LLC will not return my calls, VRBO said they would have them reach out to me but they never did. I have used VRBO for years and NEVER had this issue. This rental is the worst one out there. Be sure to check out all the fees. We paid for a hot tub we couldn't even use. It's ridiculous.

TITLE: 
a few issues (some possibly minor and one major)
REVIEW: 
The inside of the property was as pictured. The place is relatively clean and properly furnished (though there is no dining table).

Note that the property is on the main road with traffic a few feet from the property windows and so all traffic noise is heard. This may or may not be an issue for you.

Also, the upstairs residents move around with creaking floorboards starting at 3 am or so -- if you are light sleeper then that will be a concern.

On a separate note there is NO documentation of any sort in the apartment about how to use things. For example, for those from outside the UK there are no instructions on how to set the heating on the radiators. The television sound is controlled by a wall device that routes sound to ceiling speakers. There is some kind of power fuse that can trip leading to power outage. In each of these cases we had to reach out to the owners over the phone to get instructions. I do note that they did respond in each case on the phone and were helpful. However, it would be far simpler to just have some kind of NOTES for the tenants. A previous review had also noted this but we had not realized how much of an actual issue this could be. 

Finally the biggest concern is that the owners tried to charge us several hundred dollars after the fact for deep cleaning based on ""smoking"" inside the house. None of the family are smokers and so this was definitely not the case.

REVIEW: 
The cabin was perfect: easy to get to, easy to park (which is sometimes hard in Munds Park b/c a lot of the driveways are on a hill) and very comfortable. 

This was my kids first time in the snow and boy did they get their fill - we had a huge snowstorm while we were at the cabin. While that was great for snowball fights it made it tough when power went out in the whole community. Travis and Heather were GREAT in helping get me out - the snowplow had created a huge wall of ice that they helped dig me out of and got me on the road safely.

Definitely plan to rent the cabin again - just hopefully not with 4 feet of snow next time. 

Highly recommended!!!

REVIEW: 
My family has been renting houses for our annual winter trip for many years. This home is the nicest and most well equipped that we have ever stayed in. 
It was sparkling clean and the beds were comfortable. There were plenty of linens, blankets, towels, etc… The host provided coffee and a bottle of wine and there was a spice cabinet with the basics. We did some cooking and everything that we needed was there. 
I especially enjoyed the covered deck downstairs. I was able to sit on a comfortable outdoor couch in front of a fire pit and watch my grandchildren play in the snow. 
PG&E had a power outage shortly after we arrived. When i message the owner he responded immediately and offered to drive up and start the generator for us. He also drove up 2 days before our stay to make sure the driveway and stairs were clear of snow. 
Little touches like bed trays set up ion each master bed made me feel like a special guest. I would definitely stay again.

It's I the bottom floor and 2nd door down from the main entrance so everytime someone walked in and out the metal door would bang. Unfortunately people had been smoking in the apartment so everything stank of smoke towels the lot! It's a shame as the owners are lovely 🙁

freezing cold house
REVIEW: 
We have a group of people (10) and we was expecting some livable conditions at the property, where we can relax and warm up after skiing/snowboarding. 
Check in was at 4 pm. However, property was absolutely not ready. It was less than 60 degree inside and it went up to 62 by 9 pm. Management was saying that it’s normal for this house. But, after checking the description of the property, I was able to convince management to save us from freezing. One of the associates was more helpful, she brought some heaters around 10 pm.
Right after she left, electricity went off in a few bedrooms and few bathrooms. Heaters was no option anymore for some people… Management couldn’t help us. After several calls, they was able to offer me “call next day to check on you”. Guess what? Nobody called! Also, they provided info about the breaker for electricity later. 
This is not it. Be ready for cold shower if you have more than 4 people in the house taking shower same day. Boiler is capable to preheat only 5 portions of water for shower. It’s not in the description also btw.
Property wasn’t absolutely clean. Very dusty. They will ask you ti take a trash 10 min from house (DRIVING!!) and they didn’t even provided a code to the gate. 
To summarize: I paid 6k for a house with no heat, hot water, where I have to clean shelves and take care of the trash. Nothing mentioned in the description. Useless management.

REVIEW: 
Check-in information was sent a month ahead of my stay. This made the check-in process a little clunky as this information was not provided closer to my stay and got overlooked. A quick call to Charlotte though and we were able to receive our check-in information on the phone. 

The condo is located right off the Corridor run. A little bit of a push to get yourself to the Gondola but easy to get to when ending for the day. 

A couple of days before our stay was over, the lighting fixtures above the dining area and kitchen went out. Charlotte was quick to respond when messaging her early in the morning and said she would get someone there soon. I wish communication was better here as while a maintenance guy was sent over to repair the light fixture, he ended up leaving me with no power at all. I had to communicate with Charlotte to get power back after the maintenance guy left for over an hr. Power was restored by the end of the day but the light fixture was not replaced with a dimmer switch but a regular flip switch. The fixtures are very bright without the dimmer in place but I was happy to have power and my stay was almost over.

difficult isolated stay
REVIEW: 
I don't even know where to start. I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

first time to revy!
REVIEW: 
This is a great property and located just minutes from the Ski hill. The hot tub with a view after skiing is Awesome. The duel floors allow two couples (or couple with kids )to enjoy the place and still have privacy. The owners are very responsive to questions and issues. The garage is very tiny but my Jeep Latitude just fit. Warning! The garage can only be opened from key pad on outside of garage. If power goes out you cannot gain access to the garage or contents until power is restored. Learned that the hard way. I recommend leaving it open just enough to crawl under to manually open if you have a big ski day planned. The kitchen has all the equipment you need to cook your meals and a table for four. TV has great streaming options. The floor heat is very nice and fans are provided for. those who like white noise or a little breeze. Overall a Great place to stay!

TITLE: 
appealing apartment, the images are very deceiving.
REVIEW: 
This was quite simply the worst place we have ever stayed! we would not recommend it to anyone. It was just bazaar, two of the bedrooms had no lights and no light-fittings at all (one room had the most pathetic tiny LED lights near the door which was of no use at all in terms of lighting. There were no ceiling lights and no bedside lamps, no lights period! Which made it very difficult going to bed and stumbling around in the dark and we were unable to read at night either. In one of the bedrooms, the ceiling fan was incorrectly installed which meant that the breeze flow went upwards to the ceiling and not downwards to keep the room cool as it was supposed to do. This room also had the bed hard up against the wardrobe which meant that the cupboards could not be opened and used therefore there was nowhere to store clothes or suitcases. 

There was a big window above the front door which did not have a covering so the streetlights outside lit the entire house all night as though the sun was shining, this made it almost impossible for us to sleep. There were no power sockets in the rooms either meaning we could not plug anything in such as a phone, clock or radio. 

The bathroom was very strange, it has the tiniest hand basin I have ever seen and the mirror above jutted out so far that when we tried to clean our teeth over the basin, we had to lean our heads on the mirror to be able to try reach and aim for the basin and not the floor, but this was almost impossible to achieve. We were left with one toilet roll only and that was it for a family of four staying for 7 days, this is pretty poor when we paid over AU$6,691.45 and had to buy our own toilet paper! 

The kitchen was utterly dismal, I have never stayed anywhere where there are so few utensils, there were no wooden spoons, no cheese grater, no potato masher, no tongs, no proper knives, no coffee or tea, no salt or pepper, no spatula to turn eggs, one small pan and only 2x tiny saucepans not even big enough to cook pasta for a family of four. We ended up having to purchase utensils and take them home with us after being completely exasperated. 

My husband chose to repair the rubber beading that seals the window in the glass sliding doors at the front of the apartment as it was dangling off and the window would not open properly. He then cleaned the window as it was so dirty we could not see the beach!

We then had to stabilise the dining room table by installing the legs correctly to stop them from wobbling while we were eating. 

The dryer was not working despite trying every possible cycle we could not get our clothes dry. 

There was no clothes drying rack, no clothes line and the dryer was broken making it impossible to wash and dry clothes and towels for our family. We were only given 6x towels for a family of four, not even two towels each! 

There were 9 people staying in the apartment downstairs and they stood outside and smoked incessantly, this meant we had no choice but to keep the windows and doors shut as we have asthmatics in our family and the stench and fumes were intolerable, this was unbearable in such hot weather. 

Our instructions were to clean the apartment before we left, which we did, but again, there were absolutely no cleaning products or equipment at all, we had to purchase them from the supermarket! 

We looked around the house incredulous as to what kind of builder could have put this dreadful place together, we very much doubt it would have even achieved compliance with building regulations. But then assumed that someone (not a registered builder) has done a very ‘cheap and cheerful’ reno without any thought or planning as there is so much wrong with this place it's difficult to believe, not even the walls are straight. 

It then took us nearly 3 weeks to get our bond back, three emails and four texts to Aron at The Beaches Holiday Rentals before he released it, he was incredibly difficult to deal with and the service was dismal. To say we were disappointed is a gross understatement, the view is great and the images on the internet look wonderful but please don’t be fooled, this apartment is not what it seems, there are some very serious issues with it and we would never recommend it to anyone.

REVIEW: 
Kristen communicated with us very well and the house was great! It was a nice little sanctuary to come home to after running around all day to Snow’s BBQ and Round Top. Plenty of space for the family (and the downstairs suite was nice and private too with a separate kitchen). 

We returned the 2nd night to find there was a power issue (unrelated to house). Our hosts immediately came out to the property and made sure we were taken care of. All was resolved quickly by the power company. 

They were wonderful hosts and we would love to return again if the house is available. Thank you!

Stay away. Booked this for a ski trip with family. Drove from Seattle only to find there was no place to park due to snow, property had no electricity. It was unsafe to stay with kids overnight. Couldn't contact property manager multiple calls going to vm which was full so couldnt leave message. We turned back after trying for an hr. Host finally messaged he will refund but still havent gotten the money back in 1 month. I am out almost $1000. Vrbo customer service is non existent too. Left a complaint with no response yet. The property is a metal container that has been converted. There is no bathroom to wash, only a very dirty porta potty! The listing is inaccurate. Stay away!! Will give negative 5 stars. Waste of money. I plan to stay away from VRBO. We book cabins every few months - this has been the worst experience in years.

REVIEW: 
My wife and I booked this place for our honeymoon as it looked extremely promising. When we arrived the place was dirty, hair all over the couch/food stains and sticky counter tops. The master bathroom smelled like sewage. We contacted mauricio and asked him if our suite had even been cleaned before our arrival and this is just the beginning. I tried to contact the host before our arrival for the check in process and he literally didn’t answer back until 20 mins before check in. On day three the power went out, there was no electricity running water or working toilets, I know it’s out of their control but he did absolutely nothing to help us figure out what to do in this situation. It was 120 degrees in the apartment and stuffy and dark and the security gate no longer worked. We ended up packing our stuff and walking to the hotel in town in the dark. Day two no power and still no help from Mauricio. At that point we went back packed all of our stuff and left for good. The first two days my wife had really bad allergies and we couldn’t figure out why until Mauricio sent me pictures of the couch and accused us of bringing a dog even though I had messaged him immediately when we got there and questioned if they had even cleaned the place, given her allergies we tried to stay out of the Vrbo as much as possible since it seemed like that’s the only place they were triggered. My wife is deathly allergic to dogs and there was dog hair all over the couch behind the pillows. Good luck getting a refund from these people or Vrbo. Our honeymoon was ruined and was also slightly dangerous given we had to figure out what to do walking around in the dark in a cartel ridden town no thanks to Mauricio. STAY AWAY FROM VRBO AND ARBA.

perfect stay in paradise
REVIEW: 
If you’re looking for a perfect place to stay with great oceanfront views every day all day and be amongst great people in the Bahamians this is the place. There are no crowds to deal with just you, the locals and your own schedule. Cecil’s place is amazing. We like to vacation at our own pace while having the views we’ve come to love being at oceanfront. We don’t like the crowds and the tourism side of things so this was perfect for us. 
If you consider staying here read the amenities abs details more than once. This is not a fully laid out Airbnb but it is perfect if you’re looking to vacation at a wonderful place. 
We arrived the first night to no power, which was not a concern of ours as we came prepared and expected it. I email the group as instructed and Nicole came over to greet us and tell us what is going on and as to why it was out. 
She brought us a candle, told us where there was power and we took a ride and had a great meal amongst great people at Delish in James Cistern. 
When we returned power was back on and all was well. 
Cottage has all you need for a wonderful stay. 
Once you get your bearings on how things work it’s relaxing, fun and enjoyable. 
The recommendations are spot on. I would recommend going to Big Rocks store about 10-15 mins south of Hatchett Bay to shop. His prices are really good and very reasonable. As with all Bahamians he’s a really nice guy. 
As far as beaches we really liked Rainbow Bay for a nice close beach to visit. 
The Pink Sand Beach in Harbour Island was beautiful and not crowed. It can be a little crowded at the access but there’s plenty of beach. We drove out golf cart to the south end and found another access point with no one around. 
Also a must visit is Lighthouse Beach. Take the 2 mile walk to the eastern end. Absolutely beautiful. Walk up to the lighthouse and just enjoy the breathtaking views. 
As far as alcoholic or beer we visited Marvin Burrows’ store in Governors Harbour. He’s a very friendly guy and another great local to just talk to. For wine we drove to the package store by the docks in Governors Harbour. They have a great selection. 
If you want some REALLY GOOD local barbecue go see Dwayne in Gregory Town. If heading north he will be on your left. He’s only there on Tuesdays. 
Could not say enough great things about Eleuthera, the locals, their friendliness and our cottage.

cozy getaway
REVIEW: 
Linda was great! She was very communicative. She contacted us a few days in advance to provide check-in information and answer any questions we had. She also provided suggestions for restaurants and things to do. We got unlucky with the weather while we were there and were under a weather alert at one point with predicted power outages and Linda dropped off a flashlight and battery-powered lantern for us just in case. She made us feel very welcome and taken care of the entire time. 

The property itself was also very nice. It's a studio in the lower level of a little bungalow, but felt spacious and was comfortably arranged. The bathroom was a nice size (bigger than I expected) and the kitchenette was well-stocked for what we needed. We dined out a lot, but there were plates, silverware, mini fridge, microwave, and toaster oven for leftovers (plus more equipment that we didn't use). 

The location worked really well for us. It's in a quiet neighborhood and there was always a spot for us to park on the street right in front of the property. There were lots of coffee and restaurant options within 15 minutes' driving distance (many within 5 minutes), it was 20-30 minutes to the sites we wanted to see in San Francisco, and 60-90 minutes to nature areas like Muir Woods and Point Reyes. 

We stayed in winter, and it was just a little chilly in the studio our first couple days, but Linda was very accommodating and adjusted the heat temperature and schedule to meet our needs. There was also a space heater and blankets, so we were never uncomfortable. 

This property was nice and cozy and we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Linda!

Still no reply.

Day two we shoveled again and had to shovel the road way as well. Yes we had chains. Beautiful place, perfect for a ski weekend, if you have a snowmobile… otherwise don’t bother at all.

We enjoyed our stay here, it was a great location with close walk to the shops and not far to the beach. Excellent space for a family of 5. House was really clean and tidy, really well looked after (even if it looks a bit dated in parts in the photos - yes it is, but it’s fine and in really good condition). Beds, linen, pillows all fantastic, great condition and very comfortable. Pool table was fun and three TVs were great. Internet perfect. Smoke alarms went off once for no reason and another time just opening the oven. Not a big deal. Slight leak in kitchen skylight in heavy rain was a bit of pain but didn’t cause a significant problem. Would definitely stay here again. Best improvement to make would be a nice outdoor area to sit and relax outside, not particularly inviting and so we didn’t hang out the back at all. Again, not a big issue but would’ve made it that much better. Thanks for providing a nice place.

REVIEW: 
Beautiful and large condo with a gorgeous location right on the beach. It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.
3. This is very minor but, we could not get the toaster to work no matter how we tried

If you want the bare minimum this is the place for you. The location was great! Rec room run down not taken care of whatsoever, if you or your kids want to play ping pong or Foosball bring your own balls to play the games. Cleanliness of the condo was definitely not the best, stuff from previous ""renters"" were still in the rooms. Lost internet for most of the stay which sucked but not much you can do about that. Smoke alarm started to beep do to low battery in the middle of the night. Very minimum things in there. Normally there is trash bags, ziploc bags, foil, salt and pepper, sugar, coffee not at this place. It literally has bare minimum in there. Bed in master is ""memory foam"" it was really hard and sheets had stains in them. Overall the only good thing for our family was the location.

Really enjoyed the condo. Perfect for 2 adults. Any more would be a bit tight given the limited amount of closet space and how small the bedrooms are. My only major criticism is that for a 2 week stay it would have been nice to offer a full cleaning / laundry / sheet change at the end of one week....that would have happened in any case had I rented 2 x one week so not sure why it was not offered. 
The garage was just big enough for a standard SUV and that was a good thing as there are generally NOT enough ""visitor"" parking spots when you need them (at night). Having said that, the management company was very responsive when the smoke alarms went off in the middle of the night (annoying--a step ladder should be provided) and for other small questions.

REVIEW: 
The owner was nice enough to allow us to checkin early & out later, however upon checkin there were issues that we brought to his attention that were not addressed. #1 Fire Alarm was removed from the wall and Beeping/Chirping when we put it back in. We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice. Overall at almost $300 for one night, I’d never stay at this unit again.

REVIEW: 
Hi Alice, I’m providing some feedback as requested. While it’s much appreciated that accommodation like the Raetihi bach is available at low cost, and a more basic standard is expected for the price, there were a few issues. The bach was quite dirty when we arrived. We’ve left it cleaner than when we arrived, but providing some cleaning products (cloths, toilet cleaner, gloves, etc) would help future people with this. More concerning was a safety issue. The smoke alarm was left on the table and the battery was taken out, so probably expired. Also there were no batteries in any of the remote controls. Also the oven didn’t work as far as we could work out. Other items include that there was a coffee press with no plunger, and the bottom tread of the steps to the carport was very dangerous. In short, we think the bach needs a check and a good clean before the next people come in.

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stay in a rental property. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

The home is very large so there were a few areas that was overlooked when it came to cleaning and maintenance. The previous guest left a used sanitary napkin in the master closet. The towels in one of the guest rooms were still a bit damp like they just were not left in the dryer long enough.

My stay was ok, but there were several things that could have been done better. Dollar store TP and paper towels gotta go. I had to purchase my own. None of the remotes worked, had to buy batteries. Smoke detector was beeping, had to replace a 9V battery there. 

Bed was horrible, I barely slept. And the HVAC system was so loud that if I did fall asleep, it wouldn't last long. Remote work was uncomfortable because my only option was the kitchen table with non optimal chair. 

Listing said there was a fitness center. I never found it. There was a bike parked outside, I assumed it was for the property, but it had two flat tires and a rusted chain so that wasn't going to do any good.

The location was quiet and other than the upstairs neighbor having an occasional wrestling match with his dog (I'm guessing) the noise and traffic in the complex was acceptable.

For my next visit to Mesquite I will look elsewhere.

I'll start with positives. The beds were so comfortable; we slept so well! Location was great and easy to access. Plenty of space for sleeping , easily sleeps 10. Xbox was a hit with the kids. Hot tub was nice. 
Negatives: we couldnt get the radiant floor heat to where we wanted it to stay warm enough. So we used the wall heaters some. There wasn't one piece of stainless steel cookware for the health minded cooks in the kitchen. Everytime we cooked, the smoke alarm went off because the hood fan must be plugged with snow and pushes the air in, instead of out. Ping pong table net is hanging on by a thread, and one of the fooz ball players is broken. Lastly, the advertising was slightly misleading as we thought this was a house. It is a duplex, connected with one other building. Not a huge problem, but we prefer a detached home when it's advertised as a house.
Overall, a nice stay.

Spend your money on a different rental for your ski weekend. During our first night were awaken by smoke detectors blaring throughout the house, and after inspecting we realized there was no threat or reason for the alarms to be going off. We were unable to disarm the alarms, and attempted several times to get in contact with Randy (for over an hour) with no response. We ended up needing to call 911 and have the fire department show up to disarm. Come to find out from the Lieutenant that the house alarm system was not properly maintained and therefore, the only way they were able to disarm was to cut the wire for the detector. The Lieutenant also expressed concern that the house was not up to code and did not contain carbon monoxide detectors, deeming the house unlawful for rental. There were other issues we experienced as well during our weekend including trash piled up from previous guests, finding mouse traps in bedrooms, inadequate daily cleaning supplies provided (i.e. 1 dishpod for 3-night stay, no laundry detergent, etc), and low levels of water in the hot tub. You can definitely find a more comfortable stay elsewhere with better management. Save yourself the headache of booking here.

the perfect spot for a family getaway!
REVIEW: 
The location of Jays cabin home is an A+++

The large home itself is comfortable, clean, cozy & complete with everything you’d need for a winter stay. 

We couldn’t have planned our trip better. Snow had fallen one week prior, and the roads (luckily) were clear. Snow was everywhere! It was breathtakingly beautiful. 

We attempted using the jacuzzi, but the weather was too cold for it to heat up properly. It’s possible we weren’t operating it correctly?? It didn’t damper our trip one bit! It only planted a seed to book a future stay this Summer, not only for use of the giant jacuzzi, but also for some fun on the lake!

Definitely use the overhead fan/open windows while using the stove. I happened to read this tidbit of info, so I had no issues while cooking dinner one evening. My husband on the other hand, wasn’t aware (our fault), so the smoke alarms startled him while cooking breakfast one morning. It was quite comical, as my son and I stood fanning both smoke detectors with dish towels, while
my husband mumbled cuss words at his “smoking” bacon. 

The beds and bedding were so comfortable! And there were plenty of extra blankets just in case. 

Our last night, i ended up sick with a stomach bug. Without going into details, I was up all night. By morning I was still in pretty bad shape so I texted the concierge and Jay, asking if we could possibly have a later checkout. Thankfully, they said yes! Even more reason to book a Summer stay :). We were so appreciative. 

Thank you Jay & his concierge, for offering this wonderful lake home. We can’t wait to come back. 

P. S. The wifi is great!

So this place is NOTHING but a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! They charge you $35 DAILY ""resort fee"" which all that inlcudes is access to a rooftop pool that closes at sundown!! Then they charge you $40 DAILY parking fee!! Ontop of these fees if you want housekeeping to clean your room then that's ANOTHER $80 DAILY fee!! This listing & owner is UNETHICAL by charging ALL of these EXTRA fees!! You might think that you're getting a deal at $135 night for a ""beach front"" condo which by the way isnt even ""beach front"" its several miles away from the beach. Once you add up ALL of these EXTRA FEES $80 (housekeeping) $40 (parking) $35 (resort fee) You're actually paying $280 PER NIGHT!! You're better off renting a room at the Hilton or Marriot for $250-$275 at least that includes: housekeeping, parking, breakfast, clean towels, toliet paper, pools that dont close until 11pm, etc. The place was dirty too!! The first night I checked in I found feces on my bathroom towels!! Yes HUMAN POOP!!! There was also mold on the towels & on walls in the bathroom!! The floors were so dirty that they turned my feet BLACK!! If I can post pics I will!! The appliances are so difficult to work & understand because they're targeted to foreigners!! The stove & diahwasher just has symbols & knobs goodluck trying to figure out how to use them with NO instructions!! Three days into my stay the fire alarm goes off in the building awakening me out of a deep sleep that almost gave me a heart attack!! Everyone was forced to evaluate the whole building for almost 1hr!! This is what I paid $275 a night for? Day# 5 into my stay I'm sleeping & hear someone trying to enter my room mid morning? Luckily, I had the deadbolt locked & the extra lock mechanism. I most certainly heard several beeps coming from the door as if someone was trying to ENTER my room while I was sleeping!! Talk about SHADY ASF!! Day #6 into my stay I receive a knock at the front door around noon. I'm a professional poker player so I'm out playing poker tournaments until 6am in the morning I just got back to the room & finally fell asleep around 7am-8am. I wasn't even asleep for 4hrs when I heard persistent loud knocking that would NOT stop. I actually laid in bed for 15mins hoping it would go away! However it NEVER did so I jumped up out of bed. Not to mention I caught some kind of virus that was causing me to cough & experience chest pain for the past couple of days. So I felt TERRIBLE! Now I have to deal with someone beating on my door at noon & waking me up? I answer the door in a rage & it's two Mexican hotel staff that can barely speak a lick of English. Who try to tell me they need to do an inspection on my room? I said ABSOLUTELY NOT!! I rented this condo on a private lease!! Maybe these Mexicans arent familar with UNITED STATES LAW but I'm a police officer with a background in real estate. Tenants MUST BE given a 48hr-72hr NOTICE BEFORE ANY INSPECTION is even scheduled or considered! I'm NOT renting this room from the hotel. This is a PRIVATE leased condo from PRIVATE owner. So I declined their entry slammed the door. Obviously it was the SAME two Mexicans from the previous day who TRIED to ENTER my room without even knocking!! I then happen to go onto VRBO to look my messages & the owner or manager of this unit wrote me message at 12pm that was a blatant LIE that read: ""Sir sorry for the inconvenience but the city needs to do an inspection of the unit today"" Those two Mexicans wearing ""Celo"" uniforms had NOTHING to do with the city!! Besides that ""the city"" WOULD NEVER want to do a ""inspection"" on a lessees condo & they would show up with a code inspector or fire marshal to complete one if that was the scenario. So more LIES!! I am not only a police officer but I am also a contractor, real estate investor who owns SEVERAL hundred properties WORLD WIDE that I too lease out through VRBO & AIR BnB. You CANNOT just pull this type of stuff on your tenants! I will be filing a formal complaint with VRBO next due to the violations of their rules. You'll be lucikly if they'll continue to even allow you to utilize their site anymore to lease out your rentals! Ontop of ALL everything that happened at this NIGHTMARE of a place I figured the listing agent would allow a late check out? Yeah right forget that idea. They wanted me out by 11am but decided that they could do 12pm at the latest. I had to change my flight around & pay another $400 in fees to catch a flight at 5:40am so I was out in time. Then I left some food & drinks in the refrigerator being courteous to the next renters or maybe the under privileged Mexican housekeepers that are probably given $5-$10 out of the $80 that they charge you so they can take it home to their familes. Im talking HUNDREDS of dollars of steak burgers, glass bottles of coke, eggs, milk, countertop items too like: bread, can goods, mac & cheese, dishwasher pods, laundry pods, drinks, bottled water, etc. The owner had their never to charge me an extra $80 FEE to clean the room! I left the room impeccably clean minus the FREE FOOD that someone OBVIOUSLY got to take home & eat & drink!! One word for this type of behavior UNETHICAL!! Not to mention that the owner doesnt give you but 1) small omelet skillet to cook with & 1) Small pot that the top of handle broke off while I was using it!! The cookware was so CHEAP!! How are you going to rent a condo to someone & NOT have a can opener? Or a large skillet? Or a large pot? I'm filing a dispute with my bank for the $3500 that I was charged for 12 MISERABLE NIGHTS!! Oh yeah I should also make a note that if you DO NOT speak Spanish then GOODLUCK!! Because the valet & 95% of the hotel staff CANNOT speak ENGLISH!! I'm telling you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!! Don't waste your time staying here!! It's NOTHING but ONE BIG MONEY GRAB!! They carge you fees for EVERYTHING!! But they can't even speak English? Or they try to break into your room? I'm sorry but I keep valuables in my room. I don't need some strangers wondering around my room!! What if I wasnt there? Then the owner tries to make up lies & claim it's a ""city inspection""? What a crock of BS if I've EVER heard!! You're better off finding a 4 star hotel & paying $250-$300 a night to be treated way better & NOT have to deal with a bunch of shady Mexicans trying to enter your room!!

Love our stay at Casa 224! Close in and convenient to everything yet quiet. The central location made getting to everything - from downtown to hiking at Saguaro National Park and Catalina State Park - a breeze. Well-maintained condo with a small washer/dyer combo in the unit and larger laundry facilities onsite. The fountain nearby provided peaceful white noise and a nice ambience. There was a small issue with the smoke alarm and the owner was responsive and attentive. He even met us at the unit to give a personal tour of the complex and amenities, which was an appreciated touch. We'd definitely stay here again!

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stays in an Airbnb or VBRO. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismssive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach accross the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and ai'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

TITLE: 
unfortunately not what we had hoped...
REVIEW: 
I was very disappointed with our experience at this property. We stay at many VRBO's and this property was one of our worst. The issues were all communicated to the management company upon checkout and to this day, almost a month later, we have not received any type of resolution. 
 
Unfortunately upon arrival we determined our house did not have enough towels for our group. It took a day and a half before we were able to secure enough towels from the local property manager (PM). 

We had difficulties locking the front door and the PM did not act concerned. At one point we had to leave the door unsecured because it would not lock.

We also notified the PM that our furnace was not working, we had issues with the showers (no hot water and draining issues). The PM did fix the showers however for the furnace, they looked at it, but didn't really have much input. I was very concerned about the furnace as it was having a difficult time heating the house and would either run continuously (with no heat) or would heat up and then immediately shut off. This could be a safety issue and I expressed that to the PM, however she did not seem to be concerned and there was no sense of urgency with having the unit looked at. Our house was advertised as having a working fireplace, however that was not the case.

On our second day at the property, we had two handymen at our property fixing a microwave. These two men entered the home (without us being notified). 1) They did not knock on entry, 2) we were not notified that they were coming, and 3) we were not made aware of the broken microwave. To me this is a very serious violation of privacy and security and needs to be rectified for future renters.

This house has a fantastic layout, can easily accommodate large groups (once everything is worked out) and is in a great location. The owners/property managers need to spend some time on updating the house so that it portrays the value that a renter would expect for what we paid. Outlets are overloaded, there are cords everywhere (from TV's and appliances) and some of these issues highlighted above are serious safety issues. I would be concerned having young children here and I would hope that the furnace is looked at to ensure that there is not a serious safety issue that could constitute a fire hazard. The communication was subpar both locally and from Evolve. Very disappointing!

REVIEW: 
Always a great stay, however, it does need a few updates. Two years in a row the heat was an issue. The manager/owner fixed it, but, it was something we had to deal with. One side of the stove is not working and the other side worked half the time. Hard to bake if the oven won't stay on and the kitchen is part of the reason we stay at this house. The kitchen needs a good cleaning. With a professional stove you deal with a lot of grease and the area around the stove and the vent area needs attention. We had to fix a few chairs that had loose legs when we got there and one of the chairs at the dining room table is broken. The grill on the back porch also needs a good cleaning. When grilling or smoking it ends up firing up because of all the old grease left on it and it has a few broken parts. The last thing is the wood burning fire place, the chimney probably needs a clean out. When starting a fire you end up with a lot of smoke in the house until the fire gets really hot.

REVIEW: 
We rent several times a year at various properties. In recent years you can start to feel the ""blah"" of corporate or large rental groups that is reflected in their properties. It was nice to stay at a home not just a house this time, it had thought-out amenities that make a home, it had things you didn't know you needed, until you needed them. It is risky, costly and I imagine a pain to maintain these offerings, we should all be thankful and respectful because these properties and hospitality are becoming rare. I was surprised and a little confused when the actual home owner reached out to me, an actual person, not a generated text or rental service employee. He spoke like we were old friends, which was the confusing part at first but once that was sorted out we had a great introductory conversation. Fire wood, toys, games and knives that actually cut, snow was scarce and ice was unsafe but all the extras were enough to accommodate and entertain all age groups. Thank you again -RJS

Not so good - the wonderful view was blocked by vehicles parked out front, the double bed was quite uncomfortable, some TLC is needed in the property with fittings (broken and uncovered light sockets/exposed wiring) and some items fell/broke due to poor attachments to plaster (owner repaired when contacted). Couldn't see a fire alarm and the oven kept tripping the fuse box/power off when used. The owner was easy to contact on Stayz and while not living nearby, had a neighbour who was available if needed. Instructions for the use of the appliances would have been helpful, also some fishing rods or beach gear that we might borrow. Was overpriced for a shack but overall a fairly pleasant stay.

Not really a pleasant alternative space for grandparents!

Door was jammed when we first arrived. Had to try for at least 20 minutes before we got in the house. Luckily, the host answered relatively fast. The fire alarm was almost out of batteries as it beeped occasionally, which isn’t very safe. The steps going into the basement were extremely steep, we had a few minor accidents. Living room was spacious and clean. The bedrooms were nice too. Before booking we asked the host if the hot tub was accessible and they said yes, it was not. No water and not ready to be used. We tried filling it up the next morning with the help of one of the neighbors, he told us there might be a leak since water wouldn’t stay. Our overall stay was okay, just some minor house issues that they should maybe look into.

We didn’t feel safe leaving it off, so our relaxing beach getaway turned into a headache and the owner never came to fix it like he said he would. #2 Prior to arriving, I asked if there were any issues we should know about that would cause us grief. He said no. However, the beach was closed off and active construction vehicles were up and down the beach beeping and grunting. Ugh #3 for the moments between the alarm chirping and the construction vehicles beeping, even if they were silent, the beach sounds are obstructed by the loud busy road. #4 The unit is clean but it is dated. Don’t expect luxury. Everything is pretty basic and standard, including the linens & mattresses, and pretty worn down. #5 Bunk bed mattresses are pretty much low quality 4-5” foam pads not really mattresses #6 the old refrigerator is also LOUD #7 The pool area is nice. At almost three Benjamins for one night, I’d keep looking for a better spot.

It's a classic beach house - light, airy, casual & comfortable with minor imperfections that don't get in the way of having a great time. It is clearly used regularly based on the inventory of conveniences like condiments. There was a plentiful supply of wood for the fire which we enjoyed. We also enjoyed the Jacuzzi on cool mornings and evenings. We cooked a 6-course BD dinner for 8 in a well-equipped kitchen. Given that the enclave is locked, we felt safe and secure. The beach is close enough for a short sunrise viewing, short dog walks and longer stays for beachcombing. The one surprise we need to mention is that a dog can escape the property from the back yard though not from the front yard. He only escaped once and all was well. We had a great time!

It’s cumbersome to use the app while trying to bring items in and figuring out which entrance to use. A detailed map with preferred parking area would be useful. Entrance D on 3rd floor looked to be most manageable with available spots. 

The unit itself was ok but in need of maintenance. The smoke detector was chirping when we arrived but was tended to before nightfall. But primary bath was not very clean. Hair and dirty cotton balls were on the floor. Caulking around tub was gross. Secondary bathtub was peeling and did not drain properly. Kitchen needed additional trash bags. Linens for beds and towels were all thin and not high quality. Could be a really great rental with some TLC.

TITLE: 
you get what you pay for
REVIEW: 
First, this property is NOT a resort as listed. It is a nice gated community that is pretty quiet (we had one problem neighbor who wanted to stand outside and talk loud under the master bedroom window until about midnight) with a great resort-style pool. The condo itself was clean, but tired. It really needs much TLC. The sofa was hard to sit on, the cushions just sink into the frame as it is a pull out. Also, the owner was very nice and responsive, but cannot say the same for her property management company. We had a problem with a smoke alarm going off randomly and she had to resort to calling the HOA President, Andy, who came over on a Friday night to change the batteries in all the alarms. Evergreen, the Property Mgmt Co was supposed to have come over the day before, but didn't return phone calls on Friday when the problem persisted. Again, you get what you pay for so this isn't a complaint, just so anyone in the future will know before you go!

The house itself was really nice. Lots of open living area. Not well stcked with pots and pans. Broken handles and burnt pans. No crock pot and the mirco wave was unusable. Rusted and burnt inside. We kept it unplug due to the fire hazard. Also left main bedroom, the floor was sunken. Worried that the under floor had dry rot. Only cool water in the main bathroom for showers. If upgrades were made, it would be a great house and would rent it again.

cute space- dark stairs
REVIEW: 
Cute room and a great full kitchen with fridge and dishwasher. I needed to check in a little early and they were able to accommodate which I really appreciated. 
The blankets had some junk on them and because I’m a bit of clean freak I had to put some sheets over them, but it might just have been overlooked since I checked in early. 

Some notes for other guests:
1. The parking is thru a very skinny driveway so do not attempt a full SUV or other extra large vehicle (mini suv or full size sedan is fine)
2. Steps down to the space are a bit steep (and dark at night) and the handrail is unfinished- have a flashlight or phone to see at night and if you have mobility challenges maybe find a different room

Overall it was a nice space to stay

great location -- not a comfortable stay
REVIEW: 
I'll start with the positive: the house is a great location. We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak! 

The net is I would not stay here again.

REVIEW: 
Overall it was a great experience. The line for Northstar when driving from the property was very short. If you come from the other direction you wait for hours. It has plenty of room and things to do for the kids, area to play, games, pool table etc. the fireplace is nice and warms the house up. For the most part we had everything we needed. A few things that could have been better, these are small things and just would have been nice. There were no paper towels, there were not enough towels for the hot tub (only 2). The sheets on the master bedroom bed are probably from 1990 and were worn out in 1995. They don’t stay on the bed even for a minute. There are extra pillows but no pillow cases anywhere. My husband hated the bed but I was fine. DO NOT bring anyone who may slip easily or who has trouble walking in the winter. We had to shovel the driveway to get the truck in (we have 4x4) and we had to shovel the stairs and walk to the door which was very steep and slippery. The trash cans in the bear box was overflowing so we couldn’t take our trash out. The back bedroom was freezing at night but we had plenty of blankets that we brought from home.

This cozy townhome was perfect for our weekend at Beech Mountain. It was a close (less than 5 min) drive to the mountain, easy to access, and had everything we needed to cook all of our meals. The view is absolutely incredible and it was nice to just curl up by the fireplace and take in the view. I have reduced my rating by 1 star because the interior stairs of this home are quite steep. The height of the risers were higher than your average staircase and although there is a handrail, it is also higher than normal taking more effort to reach for.

gas leaks through out the property that were not fixed
REVIEW: 
We stayed in this rental January 20-23. We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

REVIEW: 
The Bad : The first thing is either add a window or list this as what it is a Basement. Secondly if you expect the noise ordinance to be upheld by the renters then the owners should as well. There is no reason I should be woken up bulg what I can assume only to be as a morning ballet lesson followed by a fashion runway in cement heels. Next the bathroom while it is gorgeous definitely need to be looked at. The sink is entirely to small and there is a strange sewer smell that lingers in the bathroom. The internet was great on my devices but the TV is so old that it can't keep up with the wifi so watching anything that was streamed constantly buffered or flat out got stuck loading. Speaking of the TV half of the TV is darkened and will SOON be out. Next the lighting going down to the property is also dangerous there needs to be more closer to the door. The bamboo on steps needs to be trimmed back, I should not have to walk around it to use the stairs. Speaking of stairs, I understand it may not rain a lot in LA but it did when I was visiting and the most dangerous thing is wet wood as steps with no grip, they became dangerously slippery with how steep the steps are. Lastly a trash can NEEDS to be added, yes I know you have the tiny trash can big enough for receipts below the sink but that's clearly not enough.

The Good : very beautiful neighborhoods. The furniture in the room was all very well crafted and clean. The studio itself was also very clean. The lighting in the apartment was very nice. The bathroom was very nice for a one person as well. Accessibility to the neighborhood were very easy and great for finding food and other things.

My grade would be. 2.5/5

This great retreat was central to all we wanted to do: PhD graduation, visiting family, swimming with manatees, St. Augustine, and DWorld. If you want to just visit all the amusement areas this house would be perfect - we went 1 day and came home for naps, lunch, and a swim before we headed back - it took us about 15min maybe less.

Main room is downstairs, we recommend slides or slippers for the stairs as the no-fall configuration of them hurts your feet until your used to them. We weren't used to glass tables and were happy to find, and use placemats! 

Doordashing was our dinner go too - so many great places around. Food was always hot - we did have a full fridge which was great.

Swimming and hottubing every day next to a lake was heavenly!! Worth the extra fee for sure.

great beach location
REVIEW: 
Our family of 5 recently stayed at this home (we have 3 older teens). The home decor was really unique and fun, and the outdoor space was great to relax in. The huge feature of this house was its proximity to the beach - just a 2 min walk and we had the beach to ourselves at times. Simply beautiful. The guest welcome guide online was great for getting us all the info we needed for check-in and check-out. Communication with the owners was extremely quick prior to our check-in, but once we arrived it slowed down. There were too many items to note for maintenance for me to give this 5 stars. The comforter in the Elton bedroom was stained/dirty, the fan ticked and a phone in the utility closet beeped every two minutes. We also had dust and dead flies under the chairs which we cleaned up. A kitchen drawer was missing the front panel and handle, and the dining room light fixture was missing a glass globe. The bunk room is quite small, as is the black/gold bathroom. There are two steps easily seen from the kitchen down to a door leading outside, but then there's another step beyond that which we all tripped down (it's all black tile) so be careful of that. The pool and hot tub were perfect. The showers in the two larger bathrooms were great. Beds need mattress pads (only a thin sheet between you and the mattress). But the vibe and location to the beach was top notch. I communicated the items that needed to be addressed and did receive an apology and a thanks so they can address for future guests. Unfortunately, it was enough to make the person in the Elton room uncomfortable for the entire stay. Bring bug spray (mosquitos are out). Hoping this home gets a little TLC for future guests.

REVIEW: 
Buyer beware. 
look elsewhere for your vacation stay. I stayed in this property with my family for a Christmas vacation and it was nothing short of a disaster. The cabin had a faulty breaker and left us without heat for multiple days. The weather was 5 degrees and a wind chill of below 10 degrees. We had two small children and it was unsafe to stay in the cabin. When we were finally able to reach the property managers we were told to book additional lodging and that we would be reimbursed. After checking out they revoked their written word. Owners didn’t properly reimburse for the time the cabin was down nor did they reimburse for the additional lodging we needed. They didn’t take responsibly for the issues that needed to be fixed in order to have a safe and warm stay. We spent so much money, just to have our family separated and without answers on Christmas. I wouldn’t recommend staying in any property they own or manage (Kaizen property’s). Apart from this the cabin is not fit for small children as it does not have safe stairways and railings.

there were 4 of us, and all 4 beds were very comfortable. The house is well equipped. We really enjoyed our stay. The only addition we think would be helpful is a banister/rail to hold onto going down the front steps. It was very icy while we were there and the stairs were very slippery and dangerous to use.

worst rental experience yet- but comfy beds
REVIEW: 
I am a frequent VRBOer and this one was a first. I reached out via message and asked questions about the hot tub. Explained we were planning a ladies night out. My request said 5. Booking said max overnight 7. Shortly after arriving I received a message about “no unregistered guest”. And “no parties” I responded with it’s just a bunch of us ladies and I told you this is what we were reserving for. I said 2 more may stay and she then said well I have to charge you an additional $20. I mean I had been there an hour. Just trying to relax. All of us 33-50 year old moms!! We work in heath care! We needed to relax! I had to pay an additional $20
Which is just outrageous for the already $411 for the night. This woman does not know how to HOST and should not be a host. Also, the dust in the place was really bad in a ton of spots, the mold in the downstairs shower window was more than I could handle and the freaking hot tub! The reason we ended up with this one smelled terrible! Like mold. The 3 women who went in first came back smelling so bad we couldn’t take it. I have text messages about it the smell still the next day. Really nasty and she just responded with “it was refilled 4 days ago and has chemicals” sure didn’t smell like any chemicals just musty mold! Even the placemats at the table smelled like mold. Bottom line is we picked this house after lots of looking because of the layout. The kitchen, the table and the living room blend together and it was nice for conversation. Pretty and comfortable. I loved the clock. The back porch was cool
With the fire and would be awesome in summer. If you plan to rent this for yourself in town for the night or maybe 2 sure anything else you should expect to be harassed for someone’s past mistakes. Oh and forced to buy the $79 insurance plan that she swears is coming back to
Me. But to me that should have been enough for
Her but no. She needs to stop hosting. I’ll try and submit our messages screenshot for those who might think I’m over reacting 🤣. We had an awesome night after the hassle and the beds are really comfortable. The downstairs room is a little weird but nice and a huge washer dryer. Bathroom is up a step and then toilet is up another step down stairs so that’s no good for in the dark walking to the bathroom. Nightlights suggested. Please clean your hot tub. It is really really gross.

REVIEW: 
Please look and read all listings as this listing is without air conditioning for 1 they do provide 6 fans but only 4 of the 6 worked 1 also stopped working while we was there, we notified them is was to hot in the place and we have medical conditions, she said she would bring a fan but it would be several hour's, we did end up finding alterative arringments for my spouse because it was over 90 degrees in home and cooler outside and this was in cooler hawaii weather. A few nother thibgs to note was stains on the couch, dishes not clean, shower was gross and had dirt on grout lines on floor can tell stained and been there. Mold on the ceiling growing mold at that. This was un safe for family with allergies also. The tv upstairs was unplugged when got there and we plugged in and it kept turning on and off broken. There is no tv in the master bedroom also no fires suppression system in the bedroom its capped off and the copper pipes rinning threw the whole place made it look bad bormally these are barried in walls and not noticable. The kids wanted to use the pool but looked like older work out group all the time the residents are older keep that in mind when booking. There is no access to the water unless climb fence or rocks, this unit has parkong spot very small and hard to get into and lot it self not super big but this is minnor. If you arrive at night bring a flash light you have to go down a few stairs hard right then down about 4 or 5 more stairs and then walkway that that is very dark and thruthfully unsafe at night. Cant see walking bagage down and hard to get down stairs even thought the wreight of the bags are trully our fault then you have to take everything up 20 or so stairs to the unit. Very outdated furnishings. Wish we coule have got our money back and moved on because this because between the heat and the unsafe area all dark and the incurrd cost to get my spouse into a cooler place cost us just as much as the few days and atleast would have been cooler but we tuffed it out. Id recommened checking other places if possible and only choose this if you whilling to chance it.

REVIEW: 
The space I would describe as a suite in a hotel room. All the amenities that you could need in the kitchen and bathroom are provided. The fireplace in the living room is very tall making it rather awkward watching tv however the size of the TV rather makes up for that. The only thing that I can say negative about the space is the only accessible door is up a flight of wood steps that are exposed to the weather, making them very slick early in the morning. We had several people in our group slip down the stairs, one sliding all the way down causing extreme deep bruising on several parts of their body. So be very careful during cold weather going up and down.

REVIEW: 
One of the only reasons we chose to stay here and not our usual place we book for ski vacations was because it offered a hot tub which was broken the entire stay and host just kept sending someone and explaining to me process to fix it. In addition, we had small children and my mother who is older staying with us we were concerned there was a missing spindle from upstairs where kids discovered and became a hazard for entire stay as well as not having a handrail on steps. I wish it was disclosed as not suitable for children under 7 as other properties do. The “4th bedroom” was a bed in the open loft area no privacy and finally the cleanliness was very disappointing, very dusty floors carpets not vacuumed with dead flies on them sticky handles etc sinks and toilets not properly disinfecting among other issues

worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Beautiful and large condo with a gorgeous location right on the beach. It was very clean, except for a hidden spill inside one of the cabinets from a previous guest. Pretty much everything you might need to cook with was there. A couple of shortcomings keep me from giving it a fifth star. 
1. The fire alarm is NOT monitored (ask me how I know) even though there is a notice on who to call etc if you set it off accidentally.
2. There were numerous lights out in the very dark and steep exterior stairway, including the one over our door.

unique, art-infused townhouse in an amazing location but mind the stairs
REVIEW: 
My husband and I loved the Forsythe House. It’s very unique and not your typical beach rental. The space has a very cool vibe and we loved the views from the roof, over the park and the record player was also a great touch. There is lots of glass throughout so we didn’t love the fish bowl effect especially in the evening where people passing by can see everything (no curtains on the first floor). Seeing out to the view over the park was lovely. But people seeing right back in wasn’t my favorite. (I know, you can’t have it both ways). We also loved that it was pet friendly. No complaints about this house at all .. we’ve already recommended it to some friends. However, if you have small kids or a small dog, I wouldn’t recommend it. The “floating stairs” in the house are aesthetically cool, but not safe for kids or dogs in my opinion. They aren’t just open at the riser, but they don’t have an attached railing with gaps of several inches between the tread and the wires they used for the railing. We had to carry our dog up and down. Just a small price to pay to reach the beautifully decorated bedrooms and amazing roof top deck. The roof top is another stellar feature and we enjoyed several sunsets up there but had to hold our dog in our lap or keep him on a short leash because the railings are very open. The location on Ruskin Square is stunning and we will 100% stay here again if we aren’t traveling with pets. Management was great and we really loved the location and the vibe.

REVIEW: 
Our stay was beautiful short and sweet. We came in for a 1 night stay because I was visiting my sister in Hobby Unit Prison which is 40 min away.
2 hours before we checked in the property manager called me personally to let me know that the unit I originally wanted (The Starling) was having problems with electricity and that the lights were not working.
He gave me the choice of two of treehouses and I chose the CedarWaxling.
All and all I am happy with our stay despite moving cabins. 
It has everything you need , there is no oven but I did see two electrical hot plates under the sink so if you need something hot you can make a small breakfast or lunch.
Has microwave, plates, keirig with coffee pods, plates, glasses and mugs. 
They thought of everything.!!!
Be careful going the stairs and hold the rail because my silly 30 year old behind fell down about 5 steps in slow motion but thank god I have good knees :)
Book it y’all!!! You won’t regret it!
Have a beautiful year!

Wonderful view, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. House is more than 120 yards from the parking lot….it was not shoveled the entire time we stayed here. I called manager to clear the ice dam that was blocking front door, which they refused to do even after I calling to tell them I fell and broke my ankle. 
My husband ended up shoveling the walkway, three times. There is a terrible neighbor who yelled at us in the parking lot two days in a row. On our last day, he threatened to hit my husband with a ski pole. 
On top of the ice damn and no snow removal, the front deck was covered in dog poop. I asked the manager if they could clean it up, which they refused to do. We paid more than $10k for the time we rented this property, so hopefully you can understand our frustration. We will definitely NOT be back.

REVIEW: 
Mattresses were all hard as a rock. My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

The property was of a great location and simple walk to lake and town, however there are a few items we feel need addressing for future guests:
The pedestal basin in the ensuite is very loose and the first night my wife leaned down on it when it moved she fell over. Having no silicon seal is also a little unhygienic.
The tap in kitchen sink is very loose and you had to hold at the base when using it, again silicon seal not effective allowing water to splash under.
We only used the BBQ once as the tray in bottom with absorbent caught fire, i had gone into the kitchen and luckily my daughter saw the flames and i managed to extinguish. Definitely needs changing out.

All these are minor issues that could be easily fixed. Thanks for the use.

REVIEW: 
I hate leaving negative reviews but hopefully an honest review will help others considering this property. 

For starters, when we flipped one of the comforters around we found blood all over the backside. No one from our group had been bleeding and when we sprayed it with cleaner the blood turned orange like the comforter hadn't been washed at all. 

It doesn't seem like whoever runs this property has actually stayed here. The mattresses are all so uncomfortable my parents rented a separate place to stay in so they could get some sleep. There weren't enough towels for eight people. There wasn't enough room for our family (8 people) to sit together in the living room. Multiple outlets don't work. Neither of the coffee makers work.

My sister called the property management company and they brought more towels and a new coffee maker. However, they never responded to my message when I sent them a photo of the bloody comforter and listed other concerns. 

My family drove nine hours to stay here. It was $2k for three nights, in addition to the separate place my parents rented, and we all couldn't wait to leave. Not how you want to spend a family vacation. 

To end on a positive note: The cabin had a lot of space, the location is great and the hot tub was nice. They also sent a crew to clear the deck and stairs of snow.

Ft Lauderdale had unseasonably cold weather the weekend we were there. 
The heater did not go on. Host informed us by email that a mechanic could not come and we had no choice but to leave 
that same evening. The house was freezing. We wore our winter coats the entire time I was trying to contact VRBO and the host 
The laundry room has an unmarked step down at the edge of the washer dryer. I fell and hurt my knee. I did not use the machines after that. The sliding doors are very old and difficult to open. The outdoor area had debris. All in all unpleasant experience. I am requesting a refund.

REVIEW: 
We had the best 3 nights here with 2 surfing families. The location is epic, Graham Colyer drive has two public cut throughs which made the property super accessible to the beach and the shops on foot, skateboards or bikes. It’s far enough out of the hub that it provides a relaxed and peaceful retreat to return to after a day at the main beach. We utilised the track through Sandcastle’s Resort to access the beach for early morning surfs. The house itself has a relaxed beach vibe and quirky charm. Unfortunately linen was not supplied which was the only down side. We took two dogs and unfortunately there are gaps under the front fences and our small dog got out one morning but was returned by a friendly local. We loved the front deck and spent most of our time at the house relaxing on it. Would absolutely book this house again.

Let me start with the communication with the property manger was awesome! He responded to all calls and emails. I am a travel agent and was disappointed with the property. The house is very spacious and could accommodate all ages. However I took pictures of the areas that were not appealing. The walls had stains on them throughout. There was a smell throughout the house that I had to go and purchase febreeze to try and remove. The sofas downstairs had several stains the arm rest on the sofa was broken and the smell on the sofas upstairs and downstairs was horrible. We went to the store and purchased bed sheets to lay on the sofas so that we could sit on them. The home needs new furniture, febreezed and walls repainted upstairs and downstairs.

great location but poor unit
REVIEW: 
Cannot beat the location for ski in/ski out convenience and proximity to the village. But my positive points pretty much end there. All of the furniture and appliances in the unit are the absolute cheapest you can find in their categories. Beds were hard as rocks with lumpy, uneven pillows to match. Couch was also lumpy and uncomfortable. Several of the dining room chairs were legitimately about to fall apart, wobbling, or crooked; someone is going to sit down and injure themselves on those things! The microwave makes a terrible sound that is not confidence inspiring. The heat in the unit is odd, the bedrooms got very hot at night despite leaving the heaters off 100% of the time we were there. My only guess is heat from adjacent units makes them warm and no there is real way to cool them off short of opening a window in the freezing cold winter. I could go on, but those are the highlights. In short this unit cost WAAAAY too much money for there to be any excuse for the state that it was in. I paid over $600/night (after all the fees and taxes are added in) to get terrible sleep for 4 nights.

It was only silverware for eight. There was only glasses and coffee mugs for eight.

TITLE: 
just okay
REVIEW: 
All in all, this rental felt like someone hastily slapped together a cheap hotel room without actually testing anything out to make sure it was actually comfortable. If you're looking to rent somewhere that is comfortable enough to feel like someone’s vacation home, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.

The location of this rental was decent; it was very close to the Disney parks, Walmart, and within walking distance to the pool in the complex. The rental was also very clean, and reasonably accurate to the pictures in the listing. That being said, the rental itself needs some major TLC. The floors and showers squeak loudly, and the tiles outside of the children's room upstairs are cracked and broken. The springs in the large couch were broken/missing, so when you sat on it the frame of the couch dug into your legs. The beds are all extremely uncomfortable/lumpy, and the linens did not fit the beds very well, so they would come off the mattresses while we slept. The beds were so bad that my mother and stepfather ended up taking turns sleeping on an air mattress because they could not both sleep in the bed on the first level at the same time. The AC was locked at 73, and the temperature in the rental varied wildly between being extremely hot and very cold. All of the curtains were sheer so it was very difficult to sleep in as light would start coming in as soon as the sun started to rise. 

Additionally, the neighborhood the rental is in is a pain in the butt to get into; the guard gate will require that you stop and hand over the license of the driver before they will let you in (even if you are using an uber). This often resulted in a long wait if multiple people who are renting try to come in. There was also very little consistency in the check in process at the gate; sometimes we were waved through without a second glance, other times they wanted to verify in the computer that we were allowed to enter and we were stuck waiting for several minutes. We mostly used Ubers and Lyfts, and the drivers were frequently stuck at the gate waiting despite me calling ahead and letting them know to expect them. One night my husband and I came back around 1 am after a date night, and the guard gate was unmanned despite us knocking and calling, so our uber could not get into the complex. We had to get out and walk around the gate to get home, which completely defeats the purpose of having a guard gate in the first place!

I booked my stay a few months ago & the reviews were great. However, as my stay got closer I thought it was strange I hadn't heard from my host. I attempted to reach him through messaging on VRBO, texts & phone calls, but received no response. Then I saw the last 2 guests who booked the property were not able to access it. I contacted VRBO & they couldn't reach my host, either. It was 48 hours out and I still hadn't received access instructions. At that point, I booked a hotel. At 24 hours out, still nothing from my host. I called him & phone was disconnected. On my day of arrival I got a message saying my reservation had been canceled & I had been refunded. Glad I booked that hotel! Hope my host is ok, because it seemed like he fell off the face of the earth or maybe even passed away 😳

This cozy townhome was perfect for our weekend at Beech Mountain. It was a close (less than 5 min) drive to the mountain, easy to access, and had everything we needed to cook all of our meals. The view is absolutely incredible and it was nice to just curl up by the fireplace and take in the view. I have reduced my rating by 1 star because the interior stairs of this home are quite steep. The height of the risers were higher than your average staircase and although there is a handrail, it is also higher than normal taking more effort to reach for.

TITLE: 
two night break
REVIEW: 
We booked a two night stay at this property at the beginning of January 2023. The house was lovely, nicely decorated, very clean and spacious. The location was great, we were practically in the grounds of the abbey and the views of Whitby were amazing. We had zero complaints about the inside of the property. 

I did have a fall on the pathway leading to the door of the property as a large stone bollard was placed across the pathway and as there was no outside lighting and the bollard was not highlighted in anyway the fell over it in the dark and suffered some nasty cuts and grazes, it was a shame is it happened within two hours of checking in so put a slight dampener on the break! So just be careful of that bollard if you stay. 

We were really keen to re-book this place and we even had a few friends that were interested after we showed them the pictures however we won’t book this place again due to the after contact with Home Stay who are the company that look after the property. 

I left a couple of things behind at the house and it took 4 emails and 2 phone calls over a period of two weeks to finally be told they didn’t have my items. Two items were left in the washing machine by mistake and they have claimed that nothing was handed in. I know full well that they were left so to tell me that house-keeping didn’t find anything was a blatant lie as well as being fobbed off for two weeks. The items weren’t super expensive but did cost me £50.00 to replace, as one item was a equa-fleece dog all in one suit and a pair of bamboo socks. It was just so disappointing that they clearly have some very dishonest staff who would happily help themselves to guests property, whether that was keeping it themselves or disposing of it because they couldn’t be bothered to save it for me. 

I also sent through the pictures of my injuries after the fall and I just received a ‘sorry about that and the ‘bollard was put there by the neighbour so not really our problem’ type of response - despite the bollard being on the pathway leading to the door of the property. 

Anyway, all I would say is, the house is lovely you will not be disappointed but just be very aware of the stone bollard and do not accidentally leave any items behind as you will not see them again.

The condo was great, very clean and well stocked, The location is amazing. Just a little ways down from the Soaring Eagle lift. The condo has an awesome ski room where all equipment can be stored and easily put on and taken off. Walk out the back door and you are on Upper Flume, a green run. You can either make your way down the bank or walk ~ 10 feet over to a staircase that is pretty easy to navigate. Head out on your skis and either continue on the green, stop for a drink at the Flume Shack or cut right and go down J Hook (our favorite blue). After skiing, it’s easy to ski right to the unit and get in the back door. At night, catch the bus right out the front door to Appalachia Kitchen (amazing food), Tuque’s (pizza!) or go a little further to the Village for mexican at Sunset Cantina (ask for Cassie!). Then come back and play your favorite game on the large and beautiful dining room table or jump in the hot tub (comfortable for 4 adults).

gas leaks through out the property that were not fixed
REVIEW: 
We stayed in this rental January 20-23. We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Home was great size with pool made experience even better. Allowed all family to stay bliss and enjoy a few days away. Down side pool. It didn’t have a rail to assist getting in and out. Step too high struggled to get mum in to enjoy pool and even myself with knee injuries. Tap in bungalow about to fall off. Couple minor maintenance and the house would be fantastic.

REVIEW: 
Great view. Comfortable. Easy to enjoy. 
Issues:
My friend slipped and fell on slick front steps. This needs to be addressed. Tread needs to be added. May have broken ribs. 

Stairs to upstairs need treads as two near slip moments occurred. 

Stairs block front entry partially. Is this up to code?

Water leaks behind kitchen sink faucet platform. 

Upper kitchen cabinet trim ready to fall off. 

Deadly scratched old non-stick soup pot should be discarded. 

Otherwise a charming retreat.

not what i expected
REVIEW: 
Upon arriving on the premises, I was overtaken by strong smells of cigarettes in one of the bedrooms.
The other bedroom had a smell of feces and other smells. Both toilets were malfunctioning.
The windows would not open to let fresh air in to rid of smell, the doors could not stay open because of the alarm.
No anti-skid carpet, which caused some slip and falls. TV s didn’t work, scrambled images. Dark rooms.
I woke up to a flooded house during my stay around 1am. Fire Dept and police were called.
Advised to call the owner. Property manager was called and no help until 4am. I was advised this house was not habitable. After removing mattress, I noticed stain of feces and urine on mattress. It was gross and fowl odor explained.
Property manager called around noon and offered another house. All my clothes were soaked by the flooding. The worst thing was the nasty mattress we had to sleep in. very disrespectful!
This was truly a horrible vacation.
I need my deposit back and possibly some discount on this rent, or total money back!
I have pictures to verify my claims.
Sincerely;
Dissatisfied Nilce!

TITLE: 
nice house, great location, beware of remax management company
REVIEW: 
Overall, This was a very well kept house and very convenient for our family. We booked this property because of location, amenities, and the pool. About 10 days prior to arrival I read a review that stated the pool was broke. I reached out to inquire and was told the owner has scheduled it to be fixed, with no date commitment. The previous renter was given a credit so I was not overly concerned. We show up and of course the pool is still broken, and drained except for about 1 foot of water at bottom, and no cover. Having small children with us made this dangerous and kept us from enjoying the lanai. When asked about the credit, Remax refused, and when I pushed back, received no response as to why. Also know that Remax will take a security deposit that is as much as a weeks rental and hold it for nearly two months. I did accept these terms, so caveat emptor. If you put this on a credit card, the interest can add up. I liked the property, but will never deal with a Remax managed property on VRBO again.

Be careful with the steps to the hot tub. I slipped and fell as I got out and twisted my ankle. We could not control the thermostat and there were not enough covers on the down stairs bedrooms. We ended up making a fire inside the house (although no wood was provided) we had to go out and get our own.

Other than that, great girls get away

Driveway was barely cleared. So narrow we could not get in. Could not even open doors to unload. Slipped and fell several times. We damaged our car pretty bad. Hired our own snow plow the following day to come help us ($40.00). 

All decks covered in snow several feet high. You couldn’t even sit outside or walk around safely. 

Photos make the place look way bigger than it really is. 

All the other places around us were cleared for easy parking and accessibility. 

Driveway is also steep. 

Overall takeaway not a safe place to stay.

REVIEW: 
Irina the host is great, easy to communicate with, very helpful. But the disappointment was the place. The building is very old. Looks dirty. There was rat poison pieces all over the building main floor. (We had to beware with our kids) The pool was dirty, my kids didn’t even want to go in. (5-7y) We took that condo to have the pool has an option. The condo in on the Main floor, we did not expect that. The balcony is in the yard with high concrete walls with spikes at top and a lot of garbage of construction laying around everywhere. So we did not use the balcony. The bathroom needs a facelift , the bath looked dirty and lots of rust on the poles. (The sea salt would be doing that ) But the rest of the apartment was clean. The location is the highlight of this stay, right across the street, the beach is there , with the popular tiki bikini hut right there. We were able to walk everywhere with our kids. The center is a few minutes away and the fish fry we went many times , 10 min walk. Bahamian people are really nice. Nassau is a great place, we loved it !

older house
REVIEW: 
We had a party of 10 the fact that it had 5 bedrooms and all bedrooms had there own bath was awesome. 
The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people.

REVIEW: 
Just like other reviews mentioned, amenties are the problem. When we got there, the hot tub was not on at all, fire pit has no propane. Pool was dirty and wasnt on also. Not enough towels. The host was very fast at responsing to address it, it was address the next day, but we were only there for 2 nights, so that means the hot tub was never hot. Make sure you chat on VRBO app to be your proof if this happened to you and let VRBO know. This house has the potential to be a great house if it gives what it advertise. I gave it 4 star because of that or else its a 5 star.

I expected a condo or a townhome, not a room in a hotel. The hotel lobby and surrounding areas are pretty dated and don’t smell pleasant. Neither does the old carpet in the hallways of the entire hotel. Check in process was weird going to a lockbox in a stairwell and told not to go to front desk. Hotel room was decent although not exceptionally clean. The pull out couch is not a sleeper sofa it’s more a futon style that reclines but doesn’t sleep 2 hardly at all. My 2 boys who are 12 and 13 couldn’t get comfortable and have room. Not sure I’d advertise this a bed. The pool wasn’t clean and had black stuff floating in it all 3 days we saw it. I felt the ad was misleading making it sound like a condo or townhome when really it’s a room in a dated smelly hotel. Communication is great with the host but I was not impressed with the room.

Electrical was suspect with melted electrical outlets. Furniture dirty and from the 1980’s. Landscaping was let go with overgrown weeds and rusty pool screening and green pool to look at every day. Dock is dilapidated. Kayaks were both broken down with broken seats and in poor condition. SUP was not provided. Upper deck seemed unsafe with ancient furniture. Really low class. Do not plan on cooking just not feasible in the kitchenette. This is a 120.00 a night VRBO not 220 that we paid. Also the owners are right there every day, they never go anywhere, so there is no privacy at all. The owners are all nice enough (4 adults). They just seem unable to do any kind of work or maintenance on the property. I just want future renters to know what to expect if they choose to rent.

REVIEW: 
Everything worked out pretty well. The game room was great for the kids, the main level a great place to share food, conversation and celebrate birthdays. 
But…..The hot tub was dirty so we didn’t use. 
The clean-up for check out was a bit too much. We spent most of the morning cleaning instead of enjoying our time together:
-mopping floors, cleaning toilets and showers, stripping beds, vacuuming, mopping to name a few was too much all the while trying to get out on time with young kids. It was hectic. 
I don’t understand a cleaning fee when we did most of the cleaning.

nice cabin but dirty
REVIEW: 
So overall the cabin was beautiful. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday weekend. We checked out the cabin to see the rooms and the bedroom was filthy and the sheets looked like someone had just jumped out of bed and in the downstairs bathroom dirty towels were everywhere. It was clear it was never cleaned. The hot tub was also filthy and the manager said they won’t clean it because on weekends they have some weird water policy that it can’t be filled. Had I known that I would’ve booked a cabin where I could’ve used the hot tub! Upstairs, the trash was never taken out and in the upstairs bathroom, there was a small trashbag with used tampons in it! Yuck! We had to sleep on the pull out sofa upstairs until they came to clean it the next day. Kim the manager did refund my cleaning fee and my hot tub fee and she handled the situation very professionally. The view was amazing though and had it not been that the place was so dirty, I’d book again! The drive up was a little steep but obviously worth it for the Mountain View!

My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

REVIEW: 
The kitchen was really well stocked with appliances, dishes, bowls, etc and the best of any place we’ve stayed. 

The place was nice but the hot tub was filled with algae when we arrived and wasn’t treated for two of the four nights we were there. The management company was super responsive to my emails but correcting the issue was not as responsive. When the shower knob fell out, maintenance was out within several hours which was appreciated. 

Loved the standing desk and monitor in the master so nice of you do have to work a little while on vacation. 

Like some other vacation rentals in the area, you have to LOVE stairs as there are a LOT of them. The builder who thought a metal spiral staircase to the hot tub was clearly imbibing or enjoying from the green medical signs! No doubt they were trying to take advantage of space, but it’s a weird setup. 

I would suggest the owners put in a larger tv in the main floor as watching a football playoff game on a tiny tv was a little bit of a bummer. There is a larger one on the lower floor but not much seating. 

Minus the stairs, I think I would love this place a lot more outside of the winter skiing season. The driveway was tight with the snow but we loved seeing the bikes that could be used in non-snowing seasons.

TITLE: 
absolutely horrible experience!!!!
REVIEW: 
I would never give a 1 star review but unfortunately I'm forced to do so because of the terrible customer service we received from Meredith Logging.
We picked up the cabin's key around 3:55 in the office and were told that the cabin was ready by the time we arrived. We arrived at the cabin around 4 and the person who was cleaning asked for 20 more minutes.
He did not let us unload and it was super cold so we headed to the starbucks. We came back around 4:40 and the cabin was not ready yet. 
Finally he left the cabin around 5 pm and let us in after 4 hours of driving & waiting. 
After turning on the heater we felt an unpleasant smell in one of the bedrooms on the third floor.
We opened the window, closed the door, contacted the office (5:50pm). They promised to send someone to fix it, but after exchanging messages they said they cannot send anyone till the day after. 
We rented this property just because of the number of bedrooms it has so we can have our privacy. But due to this issue two of us ended up sleeping on the sofa in the living room.
Beside this issue the hot tub was super dirty. We have also found most of the sheets with stains and many pillows without covers. I wore my jacket and preferred not to use the dirty blankets and sheets. It was very disappointing.
The day after around noon we stopped by at the office to follow up (since they send no one). The person who did not let us in on check-in day was there and he acted like all the sheets were clean and he was not aware of the hot tub issue until we showed him the photo. Then he acted like he was taking notes and he would send someone to fix the problems.
Finally around 5 pm on Saturday a maintenance team member showed up and he said he cannot fix the bad odor and hot tub shortly and promised to document the issues.
During the checkout, we mentioned again about our terrible experience and they said that someone from their refund team will contact us which they never did. So we followed up a couple times and they kept saying that someone will be in contact soon. Couple days passed and no one contacted us. We finally were able to get a hold of someone and they simply refunded us $30 for the hot tub only. We spent over 2k for this property and we just got $30 back despite the fact that we couldn't use one of the rooms at all plus dirty hot tub and sheets; very disappointing. 
I would definitely not recommend this property and any other properties Managed by Meredith Logging.

REVIEW: 
I don't even know where to start. I booked Welsey's home for 14 nights. We were traveling around Costa Rica and flexible with the location so when we found out the location was a different part of the country than shown on VRBO (near Nicaragua), we changed our transportation. We arrived at a new home that is not quite ready for guests. For the first 30 hours of our stay, we had no water. When we arrived, there was no power. There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

There were bugs lining each of the entry points, used soap in the bathroom, and it hadn't been cleaned in a while. We received 2 rolls of toilet paper and no trash bags for our 2-week stay. Our taxi driver got stuck and had to be pushed up the hill. You have to cross (literally forge) 3 creeks to get to the house. For 5 full days of our 15-day stay, we were without water. Welsey did all that he could but the property management was horrible. The first time the water pump broke and it took 2 full days to fix. The second time a breaker went out on the water pump. There was literally no water on the day we checked out so we couldn't shower or wash our dishes. During the first five days of our stay, the pool was not clean. Multiple groups of people came out and walked around the house looking at it. This was not very private. Multiple times at night ""security"" would drive down and shine lights in the windows. The pool was not clean until the 6th day. Plus there are many tiles peeling off. Our two-year-old got a bacterial infection from swimming in the pool water. He was throwing up and had diarrhea for 7 days. The day he threw up, the water was turned off for 2 days. So we couldn't wash his sheets and there were no extra. The taxi cost is $90 one way to Tamarindo to the nearest supermarket and medical clinic- if you can get someone to drive out and pick you up. The doctor's visit and lab testing were $190. The pros were: the beds were comfortable, the pool was nice when we could use it, monkeys in the trees nearby, large high-pressure shower, and the house was new. The living room furniture was uncomfortable and there were no extra appliances like a blender and toaster. It seems blenders are common at vacation rentals in Costa Rica. We stayed all over Costa Rica for a month and a half and this was our most difficult stay. We were stuck out at this house with no car, a sick kid, and ran out of food. I would not stay here again and hope that the issues are fixed (like adding a water reservoir) before more guests are hosted.

very split review
REVIEW: 
Location: Great location in Seminyak close to restaurants and shops. Can’t use a large vehicle for a big group due to the narrow alleyways.
Facility: The photos on the website hugely oversold the property. When we arrived swimming pool was dirty and full of debris, dining area was full of cigarette butts, sliding door to MBR was not working, shower heads in many rooms were clogged, furniture in living room outdated and need replacing, very poor amenities in bedrooms and bathrooms. The list goes on. Bottom line this property needs renovation and maintenance.
Staff: the people made our stay very enjoyable ! They are friendly, attentive and responsive. The chef Mr. Gusti can prepare excellent meals (Asian or western foods) for a large group. The driver Mr Hendrik is very knowledgeable about Bali and area restaurants and places to go.
I give the staff 10 out of 10 rating.

REVIEW: 
We stayed over the long xmas weekend 2022. The picture and description should include the statement, not for bad knee or anyone old or young that is unstable. No mention of the steep driveway (which was not cleared) Thank God for 4 wheel drive. OR steep outside steps to front door and decks with thick ice and crusty hard snow. The Septic tank needs to be emptied, as the whole house smells when you do dishes, take a shower or run the washer. 
No way this was going to be fixed over the holiday weekend so we were stuck in a smelly house for 4+ days. 
If your a cook bring your tools and supplies - basic items provided. 
Hot tub had 3 working jets and was murky. 
The carpets were stained and needed cleaning asap.
The sound of guns being fired started at 7am and went all day, which was unsettling the dogs, as well as us. Loud bags and rapid fire,. They must have gotten guns for xmas? 
We made the best of it and reported to Mt. Properties management, who offered us a 5 percent discount on our next visit.

REVIEW: 
· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

The location of this property was great. Right on the beach with a heated pool down below. Close to good restaurants and shopping. But the unit itself was sadly lacking in care. Doors hanging on hinges, bathroom fixtures falling off, furniture scratched, dirty and kind of cheap, broken window blinds, hard beds, suspicious stains on one of the only 2 beach chairs. And it needed a thorough deep clean. I had booked the place for myself and four friends and was somewhat embarrassed. I will definitely not go back. There are other rentals in the same building that looked kind of nice if you can figure out which they are.

rental is very misleading and very poorly kept/managed
REVIEW: 
Summary: Overall a very poor experience. Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!

Noise at night to early morning from bars/clubs right below front windows gave us many sleepless nights. TV was not working first three days, Paul sent someone to fix the situation.

Upon glass on the floor broken. arrival, a large window in the main living space was broken- really broken - like glass on the floor still broken. It was obvious someone had been out to slap a piece of plywood on it but there was a considerable draft , glass on the floor and in the crevices of the fireplace and NO dustpan to be found for clean up. It was snowing and about 18 degrees. I immediately started calling the management company but after remaining on hold for 20 minutes which was enough time to hear the timbertop jingle enough times to memorize it! I went and bought a dust pan at the local store , placed some plastic wrap over the window and shoved a chair against it to help with the draft since we had babies and small children arriving. . I tried to contact the property manager by email and was unable to contact anyone that way either. One of the King size beds was actually a double. The refrigerator looked like someone tool a shot gun to it, The lampshade in the living room was shredded. The 4 ammenities -hot tub,- (smelled funky) pool(slimy bottom), pool table (no tips on sticks- no chalk) and theater room(would not connect to surround sound) all had issues. We were missing an entire shower curtain in one of the bathrooms, the dryer didn't dry(heating element?) and a towel rack promptly fell off the wall when a towel was applied. I was able to contact the company the second night of our stay and they sent someone out the 3rd night. We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic. After hearing the issues they offered less than 10% discount for our trouble. This was not the luxury cabin experience our family Christmas celebration was expecting .

some issues
REVIEW: 
While Arabian Nights was conveniently located for us, the experience was one we’d like to not repeat. We were excited to check in and enjoy the hot tub and pool right away as we had been traveling all day and my family was looking forward to relaxing. Unfortunately when we arrived at 5 PM, the pool crew was waiting to repair a broken heater, it wasn’t ready for a few more hours and it was still cold. There are no instructions on how to control the hot tub/pool heat so I called Vacay Stay to get a tutorial and was informed that there are restrictions on the temperature settings unless we wanted to pay extra (they did offer a late checkout for the inconvenience though). Considering it was in the 40s and 50s while we were there, the swimming pool was too cold at 78° to utilize. In addition to the pool/hot tub issues the top rack of the dishwasher didn’t work so after another call a crew was sent to remove it, not fix or replace it. As a family of five, we ran out of dishes each day because we couldn’t wash them all in the now half capacity dishwasher. On top of that, there were only five forks in the entire house, which made for another headache, having to hand wash dishes after every meal (certainly a favorite vacation activity). We called Vacay Stay again and they did bring additional forks. 

There’s no local television programming available at the home so unless you have your own streaming services don’t expect to watch any tv. After a long exhausting day we were ready to call it a night, and what a long uncomfortable night it was!! The master bedroom has a king size bed with little to no support in the middle and we found ourselves rolling into a king sized hole all night long! This made for a miserable night sleep with stiff backs the next day (which fyi, a cold hot tub doesn’t really help). We again called Vacay Stay who told us that there is nothing wrong with the bed, it’s just a soft mattress. 

Aside from all of the minor issues and headaches above, the lovely touch of kitchen utensils and broken broom handles wedged into the windows for security because the locks are broken was special. The neighbors dog that didn’t stop barking for four days straight was just the added touch every guest is looking for! 

Oh, did I mention the freight train washing machine? Make sure to do the laundry while you’re out and about, it has a slight rumble that could easily be mistaken for San Andreas fault activity.

disappointing - items not working and not as advertised
REVIEW: 
A friend and I stayed at this property for five days for MLK weekend in Jan 2023. We had some sun, some rain and cooler temps. We looked forward to sitting outside in the back and inside to talk and write. We were visiting another friend in our Writers' Group. We were disappointed the owners haven't kept the property up to date and many things are deteriorating. We were disappointed with Vacasa, as property managers for not doing simple repairs like attaching door knobs and keeping lights working. There were post-its noting what wasn't working! We sent this list to Vacasa of the problems:
1) The main bathroom and bedroom (by pool) smell like rotten sewage and mold. We are allergic to mold and had allergies during our stay. Those rooms are only useable when the windows are open, which is cold and a safety hazard since they are at ground level. 
2) Driveway gate entry keypad doesn’t work. Vacasa knew, but gave us a code at in person check-in and let us try. When I called Vacasa back I learned it didn't work (?!)
2B) Driveway gate entry key fob in house only will open or close once. If we wanted to open, leave the driveway, and then close the gate, the gate would not close. Gate box does not respond to the key fob on any second request.
3) Issues around the house were simply noted on post-it notes around the house, as if that made the issues ok. 
4) The only outside door that works to the backyard (two others were locked down) had this post-it: “Door handle falls off.” Once in back, it’s difficult to get back in because the handle falls off (it only needs a set screw).
5) Important inside lights do not work. Some are noted on a post-it. The main kitchen light is out. So is laundry room/back hall light, which is the only light at night to the second bathroom. The exterior driveway/breezeway light, visible from the kitchen, laundry room and bathroom, is motion detect and strobes when on, which is distracting. 
6) The listing leads one to believe that guests will have two bedrooms with two fully working bathrooms, ""perfect for two couples.” However, one bathroom is across the house. The main bathroom’s “soaker tub” is a one-person wall tub with a note on it “tub is not operational”; its plumbing and tap are closed-off.
7) The bath's retro ""features"" are rotting and deteriorating. 

Overall, the house is not as advertised. Location is good, backyard and pool are nice, but can not carry this amount of issues. Repairs and updates are needed.

beautiful cabin with a picturesque view on the mountains
REVIEW: 
If you are looking for a quiet, cozy, relaxing place to go, this is where you want to be. Nestled up in the woods, well of the main roads, you'll find this little cabin. 
Inside, everything, i mean everything you need except food. The living room has a great view of the mountains in front of the cabin. Kitchen is well stocked with all utensils, dishes, pans etc that you could need. A spacious bathroom with laundry. And a king size bed, one of the most comfortable beds we've slept on. We are actually looking to replace ours with the one there it was so comfortable.
Outside is setup nice for warmer days. A sitting deck, patio with table and chairs, ambient lighting and a firepit all with a serene backdrop of the white mountains. When we arrived there was already 4-6 inches of snow and as we left another 6-10 more coming down, but we pulled up our chairs and watched the snow fall out the window.
The owner is fantastic. Very accommodating and communicates everything clear and simple. 
This is by far one of our best rental choices.

TITLE: 
everything was 80% correct
REVIEW: 
Here is my overly thorough take on this 4/5 star cabin
 
Cons:

Can confirm there are many minor issues in every room. 

Stained comforter, mildew in shower door, broken toilet paper holder, double wall windows had inner windows shut but some outer windows open. 

Fireplaces did not work.
 
Kitchen was barely supplied, no salt or pepper, gross sponges and soap container, only a few pots and pans and only 2 sheet pans total.

I know it sounds dumb but the light switches were confusing. There would be a panel with 3 switches where one is power to the switch the middle one is also power but with a dimmer and the third one was a mystery switch that did nothing. 

Dvd player seems to function until you put a dvd in. Myself and 2 others all have 4 year degrees in computer related fields and none of us could figure out the AV situation in any room. 

Outdoor space was winterized (duh) and this is onky a con because it obviously hadnt been looked after for a year or so because there was dirt build up on everything. 

The gas grill downstairs was a joke. I dont think you could fit more than 2 burgers on it and the gas wouldnt ignite even. 

Downstairs kitchen had 1 plate and a dirty knife in a drawer otherwise empty. 


It is out in the country so if you arent used to country darkness it may seem very dark. That being said the drive out there is incredibly hilly and winding with multiple blind hills where you cannot see over them until you are over during day and nighttime. And the drive into galena is 30 minutes away 



Pros: 

Decently secluded and thick walls give great privacy. 

Water pressure was awesome. 

Hot tub was clean and hot when we arrived but the floor was soaked from previous rainstorm. Also only door to hot tub from inside is through the master bedroom. (Sorry not a pro, I know) 

Lots of cups bowls and plates

Plenty of parking room 

Great view of nature from all windows

Plenty of fridge and freezer space 

Comfy couches

Lots of games 

Held heat very well and distributed heat well 

Plenty of towels/wash cloths




All in all like i said 80% correct, place honestly just needs some small fixes everywhere and it would be perfect.

TITLE: 
good stay
REVIEW: 
The property is nothing special. It is as advertised but could use a lot of updating. The temperature was difficult to control. The basement would get warm but the second and third floors were always a bit cold with the heat cranked all the way up. Matt was very helpful and the property is right up the hill from the ski resort. The slope was not fully open and the run that had the ski on/off accessibility was closed. That was not communicated to us beforehand so make sure to double check if you are wanting that option. The public pool is a bit of a walk, my wife actually drove down when she brought our children to swim. Also no one under 15 is allowed in the hot tub. There were no major problems with the service just a lot of little things with the property (broken chair, broken cabinet door, stained carpet, upstairs draft where the window unit sits, etc.) I would say it was not the greatest but certainly not the worst place we have ever stayed.

The condo was unacceptably dirty. Kitchen floor was sticky, so I wiped it down with paper towels. The towels were black with dirt. The knobs of the kitchen cabinets were dirty.
The microwave, refrigerator and bathroom were clean, to give some credit.
light bulb in the kitchen was out. Toilet ran continuously, 
the shower curtain was rusty and torn. Window in the bedroom was either broken or installed improperly and the wind whipped thru it. There was a large stain on the futon. There was no smoke alarm.
I asked for and received a refund on my cleaning fee. 
This property reflects poorly on VRBO.

TITLE: 
house needs a lot of tlc
REVIEW: 
Amazing views from roof, lovely area, great parking. The house is neglected inside and out. Furniture was swollen and smelled of damp. Missing light fittings, cracking electrical switches. Master bedroom side light and ceiling light never worked, only the far side light worked. Vacuum cleaner but no bag, we had to go buy them in the end. Outside furniture was dangerous and my husband was lucky not to be impaled when a plastic chair literally exploded into shards beneath him. Cushion pads were eventually replaced, as the ones supplied were shredded, faded and covered in mould. Many things broken, worn out, damaged by dampness, leaking, electrics need attention, needs a new door lock, windows and doors all leak in the rain, beds are like camp beds, look terrible, however, credit where it’s due, they were surprisingly comfortable. The bedding is ancient and poor quality, bleach marks, worn out elastic. Things that were listed on the inventory weren’t there. Enormous amount of Crockery and cutlery, mismatched glasses, two coffee machines, needs severely edited, it sleeps 3 comfortably. No need for several settings and stacks of chopping boards. Kitchen units are old and bursting at floor level, fridge was absolutely tiny and shelves fell off the door, all have hairline cracks. The owner did replace the washing machine, which was temperamental. Bathroom sliding door kept falling off the mounting. Both of us jammed our hands in the patio doors, as there’s no safety stop. Inside the house was like a fridge in winter, we had to clean mould several times and our clothes were wet in the unlined wardrobes. We bought many humidifiers. No aircon means the walls are like powder and the house manager was unable to replace the curtain pole or fix the shower properly to the wall. We lived with the curtains held up by tape for many weeks. This could be a lovely house, but it needs work. The patio area gets no winter sun, but the roof does, the furniture on the roof however needs replaced, it’s not just ugly, it’s dangerous. If it’s important, the TV only had Spanish Channels. We used our own steaming stick, which worked, but the sound quality on the TV is tinny at anything above quite. The house was clean on arrival, but inside the cupboards were grimy and some crockery sticky with grease, which j didn’t use, as there’s just far too much crockery and unnecessary stuff in a rental. I binned the toilet brush, after it was knocked over and I won’t go into detail, but I binned it and left a brand new one for the owner, it was disgusting. We needed to buy a basin, as the sink didn’t hold water. The additional blanket provided was dirty and too bulky to wash in the machine in the house, I thankfully had taken our own throws. No towels provided by the owner. If we didn’t have a dog with us, there’s no way we would have stayed in the house, not in the condition it’s in. The owner seems like a nice man, but really didn’t want to be bothered with me and I found myself resolving or dealing with things myself.

TITLE: 
disappointing! bugs, mould, run down!
REVIEW: 
We stayed at this property for a week in Dec of 2022. The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.

Don’t rent this place. House was not as pictured. Shades on windows we broken and did not lock. Sheets and comforters were dirty (went out and bought our own). Basement had about and inch of water and that’s where the washer and driver were located. Plumping made a weird sound that could be heard throughout the house. Furniture was rundown and broken. Neighborhood was rundown and was not in walking distance to the “town”. This place ruined what was supposed to be a celebration weekend and VRBO did nothing to help us. Will never rent from them again!

REVIEW: 
Overall the property was decent. Check in was simple. The condo was spacious. The views are nice. Unfortunately they have closed the skiing down on this side of the resort. So there is NO Ski-in/Ski-out access.

There was an awful lot of previous water damage, and it appears that nothing has been maintained or updated, ever.

The upstairs bedroom is lacking a window and is unsafe for children. The railing at the top of the stairs overlooking the loft has a broken plastic netting to help keep children from climbing through the spindles and over the edge. This needs to be replaced.

The condo was sufficient for our stay, but pretty disappointed about the overall accommodations. The floors were dirty, and we mopped everything. There were obvious spills (soda/juice) in the kitchen that were present when we arrived. The television in the main bedroom does not work.

In its original shape I am sure this was a fantastic place. It could be very nice again with a few updates.

REVIEW: 
We had a party of 10 the fact that it had 5 bedrooms and all bedrooms had there own bath was awesome. 
The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people.

The property is a metal container that has been converted. There is no bathroom to wash, only a very dirty porta potty! The listing is inaccurate. Stay away!! Will give negative 5 stars.

REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use Airbnb all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

The property itself was nice (had been updated, was clean, etc.), but it was not located in a nice area of town. We were expecting the area to be up and coming based on the information in the posting, but it was still in what seemed to be a pretty rough area (we observed multiple police cars and ambulance stop in the neighborhood throughout the weekend and watched a neighbor get arrested as we first checked in). The only issue with the house itself was there was no wine opener (which was an easy fix!) and the toilet became clogged. Everything else was as advertised in the posting and the host was very responsive/ easy to work with. 

Perhaps if it’s all adults staying at the property then the location might not matter as much, but we didn’t feel particularly safe at this property (particularly because we were traveling with children).

· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

REVIEW: 
Although this property is within easy access to the beach and the river we found the bedrooms lacked storage space, the outdoor furniture was very difficult to manage as it is heavy, unstable and hard to move. Being able to spend as much time as possible outside is important for a family. We used the bar b que and found only 2 burners worked. 
One of the bedrooms had not been cleaned properly when we arrived and there was glass on the floor in the childrens room causing an injury luckily to an adult not one of the children. 
We did find the kitchen well equipped although small when catering for a family.

Buyer beware. 
look elsewhere for your vacation stay. I stayed in this property with my family for a Christmas vacation and it was nothing short of a disaster. The cabin had a faulty breaker and left us without heat for multiple days. The weather was 5 degrees and a wind chill of below 10 degrees. We had two small children and it was unsafe to stay in the cabin. When we were finally able to reach the property managers we were told to book additional lodging and that we would be reimbursed. After checking out they revoked their written word. Owners didn’t properly reimburse for the time the cabin was down nor did they reimburse for the additional lodging we needed. They didn’t take responsibly for the issues that needed to be fixed in order to have a safe and warm stay. We spent so much money, just to have our family separated and without answers on Christmas. I wouldn’t recommend staying in any property they own or manage (Kaizen property’s). Apart from this the cabin is not fit for small children as it does not have safe stairways and railings. Save your self a headache and book elsewhere. You won’t regret it.

breathtaking views, gorgeous cabin
REVIEW: 
Our family thoroughly enjoyed our long weekend at Foothills Lodge. The views were spectacular! The cabin is secluded, but yet close enough to town to enjoy all the sights, shopping and activities. The cabin is welcoming and has plenty of room for families to enjoy and not feel crowded. We were also thrilled to find such an incredible cabin that welcomed our little pup as well! 
One bit of advice to those with smaller children, the steps leading down to the bottom (game room) floor are very steep. Make sure to be careful and assist any younger children going up and down. We had no issues (my youngest is 16 yrs old), but little ones may need an extra hand just to be on the safe side 😊 

The beds are very comfortable and the back deck was my favorite spot to relax (minus the cold weather LOL). We have already recommended it to some of our family and friends and plan to return again ourselves in the future. The hosts were extremely friendly, responsive and made check in and check out very easy! Thank you again for sharing your slice of Heaven with our family! 
PS- The cleaning crew does a fantastic job! We’ve stayed in many cabins over the years and this one was by far the cleanest and most well kept. Can’t wait to come back!

REVIEW: 
Overall the property was decent. Check in was simple. The condo was spacious. The views are nice. Unfortunately they have closed the skiing down on this side of the resort. So there is NO Ski-in/Ski-out access.

There was an awful lot of previous water damage, and it appears that nothing has been maintained or updated, ever.

The upstairs bedroom is lacking a window and is unsafe for children. The railing at the top of the stairs overlooking the loft has a broken plastic netting to help keep children from climbing through the spindles and over the edge. This needs to be replaced.

The condo was sufficient for our stay, but pretty disappointed about the overall accommodations. The floors were dirty, and we mopped everything. There were obvious spills (soda/juice) in the kitchen that were present when we arrived. The television in the main bedroom does not work.

In its original shape I am sure this was a fantastic place. It could be very nice again with a few updates.

This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open.

We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours.

REVIEW: 
We stayed at the red corvette house from Jan 12-21st, 2023. The location of this house was great for Disney and Universal. The pool heat was mediocre but it was Jan and pretty cold. The Spa heat worked very well as did the hot water inside the home. We were a party of 5 adults and the house was just big enough for us, the addition of the converted garage into a theater room really added to the space and we hung out in that room quite a bit. We made popcorn almost every day after we gave the machine a much needed cleaning. The house would be so nice with a thorough cleaning from top to bottom, new bedding, new towels, new pots and pans, replace the broken screen in the pool lanai area and replace the old dishwasher. My son-in-law fixed the dishwasher but it is truly on it's last leg. You're welcome! We would not stay here again because of the poor maintenance/cleanliness of this home. It is a shame, I wish I could give it a better review but I can't.

The property was large enough to accommodate 2 families in theory but when we got there we found that the downstairs bedroom had absolutely no privacy, blinds were missing and wasn’t safe for kids to be left alone. The blinds in the main bedroom were broken and did not close. Some of the fly screens were broken meaning we were infested with bugs everywhere day and night. The fridge was temperamental and the freezer was a small separate fridge that had cracked drawers. Door knob one one door kept falling off and buttons on light switches missing. There was a small fan in the main bedroom and 2 in the kitchen living area. The house was hot and uncomfortable as there was no air conditioning. The property did have a nice yard that the family enjoyed and a decent washer and dryer. The access to property was via long unpaved road. The house has potential but would not return in the state it is in especially for the price which wasn’t cheap.

TITLE: 
nice view and bedding - poor water/power/wi-fi and rocky beach
REVIEW: 
Some pros and cons:

1. Stated in description kid friendly sandy beach: The beach is not a kid friendly swimming beach. It is very rocky. Make sure to have water shoes. While you can snorkel in the water, it does not have a lot in the direct area to offer for habitat or viewing. 
2. The dishwasher didn’t drain making it unusable. Upon arriving it had standing putrid water and dishes in it. We ran it and it leaked so we washed by hand the trip.
3. The water pressure was minimal at best. Even rinsing dishes and showering was hard with no pressure - not uncommon to have such low pressure it dripped. 
4. Upon arrival there was half a roll of toilet paper and a clogged toilet. With the poor water pressure this was a continuous obstacle. 
5. The paddle board had a slow leak and the kyak had a hole. This became a safety concern as children were out in the ocean with sinking equipment. 
6. Wi-Fi was sporadic. Regularly needing to reset the router. It worked as long as only one device was being used but not for streaming or large downloads. If needing Wi-Fi for work, I would recommend getting a backup.
7. The power went off intermittently 3-5 times per day. While this is a common issue on the island, there was no back up generator. If needing to use a CPAP or other critical devices, you will want to bring a secondary power source.
8. Upon leaving there were no instructions besides taking off linens. Which we gathered. We did not sweep thoroughly and they charged a significant fee with a picture of the few things that were swept up. We had left a recycle box because we looked for somewhere to recycle and couldn’t find one and charged over $200 for additional cleaning fees. 

Pros: 
- the view is fantastic
- The washer and dryer work fine 
- Volleyball net is a plus (volleyball was flat without something to pump it up)
- Local dogs are kind and friendly 
- Ac works well
- Screened patio is great for dinners
- While the beach is quite rocky, the beach deck provides a nice place to relax. 
- Beds were comfortable 
- Linens were comfortable and clean

Have stayed in Palm Mar for over ten years, so know it well! Wanted a place that was quiet and not overlooked and this was perfect! Downstairs was beautifully furnished, everything we needed, internet excellent which is vital as we need it for work, and TV channels extensive. Upstairs terrace had superb sea views, although was very windy at times, and had the sun almost all day. Only small disappointment is that the cushions in the terrace furniture were dirty and old, but as we covered them with beach towels it did not matter. 
Loved it so much we tried to book for next year but not available for our dates.

beautiful cabin but needs wirk
REVIEW: 
We LOVED the cabin, but definitely needs a deep cleaning and some major repairs. The size was perfect for my husband and I and the views were beautiful. The HUGE drawback was the shower and the cleanliness. The shower floor looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in ages and there was a crack in the floor fiberglass that looked like an unsuccessful repair was made. Depending on how long it’s been like this, I’d imagine the floor beneath is compromised and a major safety concern. The cabin is in desperate need of a deep cleaning. General floor areas were clean, but there was at least a quarter inch of dust on all baseboards and some fixtures. The stove burners had cooking debris that seemed to have been there awhile. The cabin has glass covers protecting the coffee tables that were disgusting underneath and on top. They are a safety concern if you bring any children because they don’t have sticky pads to hold them in place so they slide with the slightest bump. Bathroom mirrors looked like someone had taken a wet rag to clean them. 

Positive notes: Great location to all activities. The drive to the cabin is a little intense with steep inclines, but one you drive it a time or two, you get use to it. All linens were clean. We didn’t use the whirlpool tub due to not trusting the cleanliness, but we sure enjoyed the hot tub since we knew there were chemicals in it for disinfection. The cover for the hot tub isn’t the prettiest, but serves its purpose. We had a lot of fun with the pool table and retro arcade games. Gas grill worked, but had a little trouble with the ignition here and there. I’d recommend bringing a long lighter or matches in case it’s being temperamental during your visit. Also bring a dustpan/sweeper because there’s no cleaning supplies in the cabin. 

Would we stay there again? Not sure. Cabin size and amenities were perfect, but the property management that takes care of the cabin, Aunt Bugs rentals, seem to have the same bad reviews with their other cabins they rent out. I’d probably find another cabin that I wouldn’t feel the need to clean on vacation.

REVIEW: 
Overall, This was a very well kept house and very convenient for our family. We booked this property because of location, amenities, and the pool. About 10 days prior to arrival I read a review that stated the pool was broke. I reached out to inquire and was told the owner has scheduled it to be fixed, with no date commitment. The previous renter was given a credit so I was not overly concerned. We show up and of course the pool is still broken, and drained except for about 1 foot of water at bottom, and no cover. Having small children with us made this dangerous and kept us from enjoying the lanai. When asked about the credit, Remax refused, and when I pushed back, received no response as to why. Also know that Remax will take a security deposit that is as much as a weeks rental and hold it for nearly two months. I did accept these terms, so caveat emptor. If you put this on a credit card, the interest can add up. I liked the property, but will never deal with a Remax managed property on VRBO again.

We've staying in a lot of rental homes and you can always tell when it's a home or if it's a business. This is a home. The second we walked in, we felt like we had arrived at our new home. I have a baby that loves to crawl upstairs and then fall down them and there were baby gates. The view was spectacular, the bedrooms were huge and so comfortable. We traveled with 3 families, 8 children. So. Many. Kids. And the house never felt cramped. The dining room table was large enough for us to all sit down and eat dinner together. the kitchen was stocked, we had plenty of everything we could need. We want to come back for every season. We came up to go sledding at Blackwater state park and this house was only 20 minutes away. It was perfect. Brian was an amazing host, he was prompt in his message responses and extremely accommodating. The kids never wanted to leave and neither did the adults. Can't wait to go back in the summer to enjoy the lake!

great holiday getaway
REVIEW: 
We stayed here for 15 nights over Christmas, New Years and 3 Kings day. We had 6 adults, 2 children and a 9 month old. We had plenty of room. Property was beautiful. House does need a little TLC. There are multiple things broken or not working properly. It did not bother us though as we spent most of our time out or hanging at the club house. We had a lot of issues with the clubhouse picking up our trash (partly because of the holidays and partly because of laziness) I did notify the property manager as well as club house manager during our stay. We arrived Christmas Eve to trash overflowing the front box from previous tenants. This caused animals to dig through the trash that evening and we woke up to a huge mess that we had to clean up (someone else's garbage). Had to contact office to pick up trash on 3 separate occasions because they were not coming daily like they were supposed to. 

Some things that need attention in the house: microwave vent cover being held together with twisty ties, couches are super broken in (you need to sit on a pillow so you don't fall in), comforters on bed were extremely dirty and stained (we immediately stripped them off the beds and did not use them), beds are very low to the ground (did not bother us but was difficult for our parents getting in and out of bed) shower head seals broken in master bed room so you can't use one of the shower heads, handle in master bath broken in shower, master bedroom lamp broken, TV in master could not load any channels, and towels dirty upon arrival (which we had to wash prior to using), pool light did not be turn on and we had small ants in the upstairs bathrooms. Even with all that being said, we had a fabulous time and would stay here again. 

The property manager was great. She was quick to respond and went above and beyond by decorating for Christmas and setting up a tree for us (at my request). 

The clubhouse was fun and had a great little new years eve party by the pool that our family enjoyed. You do need to purchase your own key card for $20 if you don't want to wait in the line to get in the property. Sometimes the line was very long and depending on who was working would take much longer. Some requested to see your confirmation emails with your booking while other required your photo ID, some took time to write all your info down while others did not. We found it easier to just purchase the nonrefundable card after a couple of days waiting in the line. Everyone at the front gate was extremely friendly.

TITLE: 
regrettably disappointing
REVIEW: 
First, the positives: 
1) Jeffery, the online assistant on Vrbo was great at responding my questions when I had to reach out reg this rental. 
2) The house had a fenced in backyard, 4 small rooms, tile or vinyl floors, clean bathrooms and beds. 
3) Despite the fact that when you lookup the address on google maps, the first thing you see is several police cars and armed officers fully crashing on the house across the street… the neighborhood was quite and pleasing in person; only heard 9 gunshots coming from a house nearby, the night before we left. Side note, it was NOT on 4th of July or New Year’s, in case you wonder. 

Now, the negatives:
1) We did not receive any communication, confirmation email, property address or check-in instruction till WE reached out the night before taking off to this destination. We first tried calling the phone number provided but nobody answered and the VM was full. Then we finally got in contact with Jeff through Vrbo’s website to provide us with the info. 
2) The floors of the house were covered in a dark dust, as if you walked into an open-door restaurant in Manhattan, that stained everything that came in contact, from my dog’s paws to our luggage and anything else in between. The rugs and runners around the house were, as expected, also stained with this dark debris (or just dirty, it didn’t stop to check). I also found some sort of large bed cover inside the washer machine that smelled like cat urine (and No laundry detergent anywhere in the house). 
3) Cockroach – there were several juvenile live roaches found crawling around the bathtubs, laundry room, inside the dishwasher! We had to sleep with all the lights on to try to avoid waking up with roaches on the bed. To their defense, there were cracks between the ceilings and the walls, all around the house; understandably hard to keep pests out. 
4) The backyard did not have a volleyball net, but only a deflated ball around the bushes. There were pieces of glass and other debris that made the yard unsuitable/unsafe to let your pet (or other children) loose. Multiple areas with dog feces around the yard from previous residents. Only 1 garbage bag, no replacement bags, which did not help... 
5) Lastly, the guest bathroom had a small leak coming from the back of the toilet, that we noted only after we tried to flush the toilet. Needless to say, we had to close the outlet valve leading to the tank and mark that bathroom out-of-order.

REVIEW: 
One of the only reasons we chose to stay here and not our usual place we book for ski vacations was because it offered a hot tub which was broken the entire stay and host just kept sending someone and explaining to me process to fix it. In addition, we had small children and my mother who is older staying with us we were concerned there was a missing spindle from upstairs where kids discovered and became a hazard for entire stay as well as not having a handrail on steps. I wish it was disclosed as not suitable for children under 7 as other properties do. The “4th bedroom” was a bed in the open loft area no privacy and finally the cleanliness was very disappointing, very dusty floors carpets not vacuumed with dead flies on them sticky handles etc sinks and toilets not properly disinfecting among other issues

REVIEW: 
Property has a great location. House could be truly wonderful but the upkeep and cleanliness were terrible. The whole house was not cleaned PROPERLY to start. Food was found on the floor, a smoking pipe was found out on the outside deck by the table (left it there), there was dog poop on the outside of the slider door (left it there), air vents were just covered in dust/debris, bathrooms were the worst with mold & mildew on the tiles and glass doors. To me it seems like a property management issue but regardless the overall feel of the property was definitely not as described. Also, the games downstairs were not very inviting as the shuffle board was all ripped up, the pool table felt was very old.....again, not was represented on the listing. Anyway, we were only there 2 nights and made the best of it and honestly I did not want the hassle of dealing with everything above and ruining the little time we had. The house could be a wonderful place but the care and treatment of it has been neglected for a long time.

REVIEW: 
The property and house itself were OK. The outside landscaping was pretty trashed. Lots of down brush and such. No grooming of the yard.
Bathroom was gross. Mildew and grime in all the corners, hair stuck to the walls, dead bugs on the vents, soap scum partially wiped off the shower walls, mildew all around the window sealer. Bedroom had a freestanding AC unit- the vent to the window was cracked in 3 places. Cracks were attempted to be fixed with dish towels, zip ties and duct tape. Lots of dead bugs and dust around the vent/window area.
Lots of spiders in the kitchen, randomly throughout the stay we would see spiders on the walls and ceilings.
When attention was brought to the owner of the issues his reply was ""this is due to the age of the house"".
Since when is CLEANING your house have anything to do with the age? You can have an old house and keep it clean!
When I asked for a cleaning fee refund he said that's not possible.
STAY AWAY.

worst vrbo stay ever
REVIEW: 
This is the worst VRBO experience we have ever had. First of all, I consistently received two emails for every reminder and every check in one from Austin vacay and one from a service manager. This made the check in process difficult because the code sent to me did not work. I called the property manager who answered after the second call and gave me a different number which worked. They apartment in our opinion was not at all how was presented on the website. The furniture and art is different (no big deal). The outside door frame is completely rotted away, the kitchen cabinet and drawers do not close. There is black mold in the air vents. On almost every door inside and out is chipping and peeling paint. They lid on the toilet is broken and clearly glued together. The apartment smells very strongly of odor ban cleaning solution and as it wears off you can smell cigarette smoke. The units around this apartment all have broken blinds and loud barking dogs (I know the property manager can't control the neighbors, but something that would have been nice to know). Both times I contacted the property manager (check in and when we wanted to talk about the property) I had to call twice before he would answer. Needless to say, we left the property and ended up getting a hotel. I called the property owner and explained our concerns, he was not willing to refund any of the money except the cleaning fee, which I still have not had returned to me. Had this been a cheap rental I wouldn't have cared so much but as you can clearly see if you're considering it, it isn't cheap.

REVIEW: 
This property is in a great location close to town and in a quiet neighborhood. It has a very well equipped kitchen and was very clean. The beds were comfortable. The lighting, however, was terrible. It was impossible to read in the evenings: there were no table or floor lamps. The driveway had no lighting.
The property was supposed to have garage and laundry access, but it was locked. 
The snow and ice had not been removed from the deck and home entrance before our arrival or during our stay and was very slippery. We had no access to a shovel. 
Importantly, when I contacted management regarding this, their response was not helpful.
I would stay at this property again, if the lighting issue was resolved. I think in winter months that snow removal for safety should be a priority.
Thanks.

worst property ever!!!
REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

REVIEW: 
It had snowed during the day before we checked in and the property manager had not snow plowed the steep driveway or the many stairs that lead up to the house. We were not able to drive our suv up the driveway even with chains on. It was dark and slippery and dangerous and not a good welcome. We had to carry all our luggage up the slippery steep driveway then up the icy stairs in order to get into the house. I tried calling the 24/7 phone number listed but it was only a recording. I tried contacting the owner but there was no option to contact them either. Once we got into the house I saw a different 24/7 phone number listed on the paper posted on the wall. Finally after over an hour, I was able to speak to someone with the management company. They sent a guy over to shovel off the driveway and he put cinders and salt down but didn’t clear the stairs. After that we managed to drive one car up but we still were not able to get the suv up the driveway. Later that night we saw two snow plows working on the property next door. We ran out and asked them if they would be so kind a to clear our driveway and stairs snd they did. They said they we’re working for the management company that worked for the properties next to us and they weee preparing for the arrival of their guests. We wondered why our property was not cleared before we arrived. The house itself was very nice and clean and cozy. The balconies were beautiful and it also had a lovely yard for the kids to play in and make snowmen. The instant hot water was a nice touch. They did forget to provide paper towels and dishwasher soap but they brought that over as soon as we asked. It was a great location and we would love to stay there again as long as they cleared the driveway and stairs before arrival.

solid choice for the price
REVIEW: 
We stayed here during some very cold, nasty weather. The hosts were 5 star hosts who no one would give a bad review. It makes you feel bad about noting imperfections about your experience with this apartment. 

During cold weather like we experienced, I would give the place a 3 out of 5. Our first night, we were freezing inside. This building observes the laws about maximum heat levels. That means the heat can stay on for a certain number of hours in the morning and evening so there is no heat while you sleep. Also there is a maximum temperature the thermostat should never exceed. It was literally freezing outside and there were definitely drafts. If I knew this before going, I would have booked elsewhere. Hotels and Airbnb's that I have been to prior do not enforce these rules. Anyhow, the next morning, the apartment became warmer when our host allowed the heat to be on continuously when we were home and they provided a space heater for the back bathroom which was the coldest area in the apartment. I only wish they noticed how cold it was and got permission for continuous heat from the beginning. 

Besides this, the apartment had a number other problems which are common for lower cost places. Shower doors which don't slide well, a leaky faucet, poor bathroom ventilation, chipping paint / mold in the bathroom etc. For anyone sleeping on the sofa beds in the front of the apartment, there will be significant night noise. But you don't hear that noise in the 2 bedrooms. 

Bottomline, if you want a GREAT location and a cheap accommodation, this is a fine choice. If you can easily afford better, I would choose somewhere else, especially if it is cold outside. For those considering this apartment in the hot summer, I wouldn't worry as much in early summer. I imagine that the place is a bit like a cave which will remain cool in the heat for quite awhile.

REVIEW: 
We understand the importance of reviews when selecting a place to stay and we want to share our experience with others.

The positives of this property include a nice outdoor area, ample space for a large family, and the added bonus of a TV in the garage. The location is also good, with everything being within a 10-minute drive, however, note it is too far to walk up the hill to the beach with young children under 6.

Also for the high cost for the week, we felt that the photos did not accurately reflect the condition of the inside of the property and were disappointed upon arrival. The property appeared to have been rushed to market and although you can see the owners have made efforts to improve it, there were still some unfinished details such as mismatched wooden floors and a large gap outside the downstairs bathroom.

The upstairs main room was exceptionally hot during the summer and the curtains were poorly attached and did not cover the windows, making it difficult to use them completely. Additionally, the cupboards in the upstairs bathroom appeared to be an issue with sizing and missing drawer inserts also the shower was missing a screen, and water doesn't drain well leaving slip hazards.

The lack of air conditioning made for very uncomfortable nights, and the fans provided were not working. The property managers were quick to rectify the situation when informed, but it was still a disappointment. The sheets provided were a rough polyester blend and did not reflect the high cost per night.

The internet connectivity was poor and could not be used upstairs. My husband had to work sitting right next to the router as that was the only place it worked.

While we appreciated the location and area, we will look for a place closer to the beach or with a pool and better inside conditions and air conditioning if we holiday in the area again. We hope that this feedback will provide guidance and areas for improvement for future guests. We have also provided more details to the owners direct to ensure a positive guest experience and with some amends are sure the home will continue to improve in its standards.

First off the instructions they send you to get in are not correct, they need to update them, we had to call the management to find out how to get into the unit. when we got in the unit it was very clean, but dish in cupboards were dirty, I always wash them first but these were bad. Everything was in working condition.The bed could be replaced, its was lumpy in the middle, like the mattress would bunch up. The couch is very uncomfortable, its a lounger and is hard to get out of, they need to put some lamps and end tables in the living room so you don't have to sit in the dark, yes, there are overhead lights but who wants to sit with those bright lights on. There is no information book for renters on how to use things, hard to figure out the TV with out instructions. Also they could replace the tub with a walk in shower, that is one of the dangerous tubs we have every used and no grab bars in case you lose your balance. The other thing we were disappointed about was that the pool was not heated, guess it has been out since the last hurricane, too bad the host didn't inform us of this, also there was no outdoor seating, as was shown in the pictures. We called about heat and patio seats, but got no real answer, said she would get back to us on it. Never did. This place is in a nice location, close to everything.

My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Again, my review: 0/10

Then someone with a dog that wouldn't stop barking checked in next door... no fun.

There was a moldy smell when we moved in (like grandma's closet), and the curtain rod in the shower was loose (and fell on my head). Called Vacasa and they handled the rod, but said the smell was ""curry"". Also, talked to Vacasa and Vrbo about partial refund and they gave me a long runaround, no call backs, etc. 

I wont stay in a vacasa managed property again.

just as advertised!
REVIEW: 
Property is exactly as advertised! Beautiful view of lagoon, and Large Iguana sunning in tree just outside the patio enclosure!

The Good: Lots of room to spread out; gorgeous upstairs bathroom/tub/ shower; beds were SUPER comfy; washer dryer newer and worked great: came stocked with lots of spices and starter coffee and filters (may have been left by previous occupants); third floor patio furniture nicely padded; private. VERY CLEAN! 

Property Highlights: The clean pool, the jetty you could walk out to see sunrise/ sunsets, plenty of outdoor seating in and out of the sun. Lagoon is full of beautiful fish and lobster. Bought a snorkel mask at Walgreens (a short bike ride away). Clean, friendly Security at Gatehouse and Grounds Staff do a great job keeping things garbage free and tidy.

The “However…”s BIG THiNG: (Condo itself) the ground floor level has a step up to the landing and bedroom, then you turn to go up to the main level. Coming back DOWN, turn on the landing, open door into downstairs living room and there’s a STEP DOWN that I missed twice, and my mother actually fell. It’s just a regular step down in the same color tile that needs a sign, or yellow/red tape on the ground level. I had a laundry basket in my hand so stumbled down into the room and caught myself. My mom fell down and caught herself on the pullout couch bar and we spent the day at the hospital. EASY FIX, I am writing to the owners. I just don’t want someone else’s vacation to be spent at Mariner’s (GREAT little hospital and EMS and ER staff!) I pray you don’t need it. It was 100% avoidable.

The stairs are steep and narrow. Anyone with knee/ ambulatory issues ((or big feet!) should just put up the money and go stay at the Mariner’s Club as their condos are one-floor living (and gorgeous-my sister stayed there). 

The third floor patio was missing a screened panel, but I am assuming it’s from a recent storm and on the To Do list as the gnats came out in the evening, and there was a paper wasp nest above it so anyone with a bee allergy would have been concerned. 

Tiny things: Two shower doors didn’t have plastic/rubber dams so water came out under the door which is no big deal EXCEPT when someone is more susceptible to a slipping hazard.

Property (not condo itself) The walkway lamp light was out so it made traversing the outdoor stairs from main floor patio to lagoon walkway difficult (we used cell phone light but I was still not the safest)

REVIEW: 
The view is nice, location is close to the shuttle and simple to get to town. The snowboard/ski/shoe removal/storage area on the ground floor is a positive. The garage was big enough for my full size pickup. The furniture in the sitting area is not comfortable. Couch needs new cushions. TV has blown speakers. The fireplace has an annoying thumping sound when it gets going. The master BR does not have any place to put luggage on...used a chair from dining table. The master bed is fairly hard. The master bath floor is extremely slippery when wet!!! Overall, good place to stay, but needs attention to upgrades for the price.

gorgeous house but cleanliness and amenities of property were lacking
REVIEW: 
Mattresses were all hard as a rock. My back hurt after the first night. 1 TV in all of the house. No access to master closet so had to hang my clothes in one of the other rooms. The owner should at least provide a rolling rack. Extra pillows were stored under the bed on the floor. Found crumbs and pills in corner of floor in kitchen. Thank geez we didn't have infants or toddlers with us. I swept so much debris from under fridge and stove. Kitchen appliances are the cheapest of the cheap. Master bathroom lights and outlets went out 2 days into trip and I contacted Vacasa but they never responded. Downstairs shower needs an anti slip mat as my friend fell while showering and had to leave to seek medical attention on my 40th Birthday. Checkout time is 10am but cleaners were sitting outside the house before then causing me and my daughter to stress about having to pack up by ourselves since our friends had to leave. My friend found a booger on her comforter in the downstairs bedroom so not sure how often it is cleaned between guests. Spa needed to be filled with water but there were no instructions on how to do that. With heavy snow the entire trip the driveway wasn't plowed once and the street the house was on wasn't plowed on Sunday making it difficult to get to since the house is uphill. The house is gorgeous but we just had too many issues with our stay for the amount of money it cost. We were there to spend my 40th Birthday together and it ended on a bad note.

great apartment - everything you need!
REVIEW: 
My husband and I just wanted to get out of the house for a weekend, and this was a fun little trip for us!
 The keyless entry is really a brilliant idea! The apartment is just as described in the ad. We are walkers and had no trouble walking to H Street where we found restaurants, Whole Foods Market, plus free transport to Union Station. We did use Uber for the first time and loved it - DC is super-tricky to drive around (for us), so it was a great choice.
The bed was a semi-firm memory foam mattress, very comfortable and the shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The shower floor was a little slippery so I put down a kitchen towel for safety - it was great, otherwise! There was plenty of streaming channels on tv, and we had no trouble with the WIFI. We highly recommend this apartment and would stay here again!

brand new beautiful house
REVIEW: 
We overall had a lovely time in this beautiful house. Excellent views and quiet neighborhood. Close drive to the ocean. Kitchen had everything that we needed, bedrooms all had tv's and comfortable beds. Excellent communication with owner and property manager. We were assured that the house would be ready for us as I had voiced my concerns about the fact that there were no photos of the interior on the website. There were a few unfinished items like wires hanging from the ceiling, and water not turned on to the dishwasher or washing machine which we needed to problem solve. The home is filled with floor to ceiling windows. Our son's bedroom was so bright and hot in the morning that he would wake up early and come into our room. Window coverings will help with this issue. Also, window coverings in the master bath and closet would be helpful, as I needed to keep the lights off so the neighbors would not be frightened when looking up. The pool water is cold and we had thought that there was a jacuzzi that would at least be warm. However, the jacuzzi only has jets, NO HEAT. Thank you for allowing us to enjoy your home, we had a wonderful vacation!

REVIEW: 
This is the second time I stayed on this property, in a different unit. It was an anniversary getaway. So, I trusted that it would be a good experience. The unit that we were in had some major hiccups. But overall, it was a good weekend and a good getaway. If I stay there again, it won't be in Seahorse 2-B unless the major issues are fixed! It was a comedy of errors!

The issues: 
1. Inadequate heating. 
this was a major issue, in that the gas fireplace stopped working on our second night. The gas fireplace was the only source of heat for the large living room area. The property manager (who is stellar and the major reason why I didn't give this review a low rating!) came out after 9:30 p.m. at night, after I had been communicating with Vacasa for 1.5 hours with no success (I think I was talking to a robot). The property manager identified that the gas fireplace was not safe, after he had attempted to fix it (the odor of the gas was strong), and said he would bring a space heater by in the morning. We used a gas oven to heat the living room. Luckily there was a cadet heater in the bedroom, so we didn't freeze. he brought out a space heater the next day, and it served us well for the next two nights. The housekeepers and property managers were excellent in their response! I hope that they are paid well. The senior house keeper brought by extra blankets and communicated with us throughout the lack of heating. She suggested using the oven to heat the room, which turned out great! It felt like a fancy camping trip, but I had forgotten to bring any marshmallows to roast.

2. There is exposed wiring behind the refrigerator. No outlet plate cover. This is an easy fix. 
3. The outlet in the bathroom, beside the bathroom sink, is not grounded. Again, an easy fix.
4. Molding is being held together with masking tape. 
5. The IKEA dining chairs need to be repaired and tightened. They were very rickety.
6. The sofa has unstitched upholstery that needs repair. 
7. it wouldn't hurt to have calking around the windows, as we could feel the high winds. 
8. A brighter light bulb in the bathroom would be nice. 
9. Coat Hooks! There is absolutely no place to hang clothing in this unit. It would be a beautiful use of space if about 8 coat hooks were installed in the hallway. 

I'm giving a huge shoutout to Anita, Tim, and Nathan, who were stellar in their support! The property managers and housekeeping staff are amazing!

REVIEW: 
It started with us arriving in the early evening and it was 32° outside and I had my twin 18 month old grandsons with me, the front door law had been broken and not been fixed. It took us over 45 minutes to work with Vacasa to finally get into the house, the trash had not been picked up and was completely full and also the owners had stayed previously and it had not been clean. They were long black hair strands throughout the house. They were exposed wires on the living room floor, which I have no idea what they were. The heating is atrocious, part of the house is burning hot, and the rest is freezing . Vacasa is the worst management, and. I did a review and they will not post it every time you call Vacasa you get a different person from.
I would not recommend this property for anyone

REVIEW: 
My family travels often and almost always stay in a rental property. We are usually very happy with rentals, but this one was different. Check in was a little tricky but not too bad, 4/5. The property has black mold growing in/around the ducts/hvac unit. The curtains in the bedroom were ripped and partially off the curtain rod. As soon as we checked in I texted the property manager about damage in the unit and he was dismissive responding with ""the windows were just replaced and the second bathroom is new"". It became clear that Bill is protective of his property and did not want to hear any negative feedback. There was one smoke detector hanging from the ceiling by its wires another was completely covered in plastic secured by blue tape. (I have photos of the mold, curtains and smoke detectors but cannot find a way to add them to this review.) The complex was nice, the pool was nice as well. The complex very much gives off a retirement village kind of vibe, some of the residents were friendly, others were kind of rude even going so far as to refusing to share the elevator with us. The view from the condo is beautiful. We found the beaches in Key West are beautiful to look at, but pretty rocky and with lots of seaweed. Aside from the beach across the street, this condo is not walkable to pretty much anything. Aside from this condo and the beaches, we absolutely loved Key West. The history and culture of this island are great. The condo was well stocked with pool and beach gear, food items. Overall, I'd say our visit at this property was ""ok"" but the smoke detector issue did make me feel uneasy. We paid $3,500 for the week and I'm having a hard time justifying paying that price.

Booked this house for my 35th birthday and was very disappointed. The property manger told us the pool was heated and it wasn’t…. The house had exposed electrical wires both inside and out. It was honestly just rundown… We stayed one night and then left two days earlier to stay at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. After two hours on the phone with VRBO we were able to get some of our money back for the other two nights.

REVIEW: 
Honestly one of the nicest condos we have rented. Everything was as per the description. Very comfortable bedding (thank you), we’ll equipped, calphalon cookware and actually sharp knives! Walking distance to the gondola and can ski back even closer. Shuttle service is very helpful and don’t need a car. Hot tubs were HOT which was great after a day on the slopes. 
Would have gotten 5 stars if not for the following: 
- kitchen lighting is terrible. So poorly lit, makes it feel like you are prepping by the light of a flashlight. 
- One of the bedroom lamps was broken 
- The dishwasher has a lower tray that constantly rolls off the rail, and is so close to the drawer for the trash that you usually can’t open the door because the trash door hasn’t closed completely. 
- Toilet in the master would teeter when sitting on it. 
- Smoke detector dangling from wires in the hallway. 
- Shuttle service is very slow. While they will take you anywhere, when they say 15-20 min, expect more like 30 min. Still, cheaper than an Uber. 
- can hear neighbors upstairs, but not intrusive 
Overall though, it was a great place to stay and I would recommend it.

REVIEW: 
The location is incredible - just a few minutes from shops, restaurants, casinos, Heavenly and the lake. The house is actually quite spacious and having the garage to park in was a huge bonus because we didn’t have to defrost and scrape snow off the car. Plenty of towels provided and the kitchen was fully supplied in terms of cookware etc. The hot tub worked wonderfully and we did enjoy our stay however the house could use some TLC. Nothing major, just dated and a little dingy, dings in the walls, old carpet, chipping floor in shower. Pool sticks were old and broken, closets and drawers had some junk in them, loose wires sticking out of walls. All that being said we’d stay here again for the purpose we needed becuase of the location, the hot tub and the space!

REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

Top floor unit is good, but it's adjacent to Pee Road, so you hear work vehicles. Unit is in pretty bad state of repair. Rusted/broken window levers, broken screen, shower curtain. Floor water sensor went off while we were at a restaurant (which we're sure the neighbors loved) and had to get Prop Mgr via phone to walk through how to deactivate it. Several lights were not working (one hanging from its cable). Microwave was non-functional when we arrived, but they brought another that was placed on the countertop. TVs are small, antiquated, and difficult to operate. 1 room doorknob was broken.

delightful pinnacle 180 ph6
REVIEW: 
My wife and I had a wonderful time in PV, and enjoyed staying in PH6. The check-in process, with Javier (PVRPV) was flawless, despite our late arrival (thank you, Volaris). The unit was clean and fully furnished, and the view from the balcony/patio really nice.

The only negatives were mostly beyond the owners control: way too few outlets (only 2 in the kitchen and none near the counter where one might use a laptop); slippery tiles by the pool; inconsistent maid service (we found towels in the dryer, despite being there 8 nights the sheets were not changed, and we were left to fold the towels after the maid service during the week). We found the cupboards too high, by Javier acquired a step stool (gracias), and the unit could use more towel hooks in the bathrooms (an easy Home Depot fix).

All of the appliances worked really well, and the unit did not lack for any. We found music on the TV system by accessing YouTube via the Roku. We found an extension cord, which we used in the kitchen for a 3rd outlet - a great fix). The beds were very comfortable, the pillows great too, and the A/C units were both easy to use and very efficient.

All-in-all, a great stay - thank you so much for sharing your condo with us. ATBster

REVIEW: 
Location Location Location! Steps from Kam II beach and a few restaurant options, this is a great location. Management was very responsive and helpful, resolving minor issues quickly and even providing advice/suggestions about the area. Kihei is great, although keep in mind it is about a 30-45+ drive to any of the other areas on the island you may want to visit (unless visiting Wailea).

Unfortunately for families with children, this condo complex is geared more towards retirees with many rules restricting activities and encouraging quiet on the property. Normally not a big deal to comply with, however there were several days during our stay when ocean conditions were not safe so we were unable to use the pool and grassy areas on property as a backup activity plan. 

Luckily Maui has many options to keep kiddos occupied but I wish the listing would have been more clear about the on property restrictions that could impact families traveling with small children.

My Review: 0/10

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

Again, my review: 0/10

TITLE: 
good, but should have and could be better
REVIEW: 
The size of this location was very good for 6 people. The view & location were excellent. There was NEVER a shortage of towels, for both bathrooms & the pool. Nice job there!
There were a few minor things that the owner should fix when you are paying $4,000+ for a week. 
The sliding pocket door leading to bathroom in master bedroom needs leveled. 
Most of the sliding doors leading to the pool deck need to be lubricated; easy for adults to slide but not seniors. 
The light in the laundry room needs a new ballast, takes forever to come on at times. The clothes dryer takes too long to dry a simple load of towels.
The AC unit in the master bedroom needs recharged/serviced. We set to 70 degrees & it never went below 73 for an entire week. 
The handle in the master bedroom sink came right off in our hands. Simple plastic piece underneath broke off. 
The other sink in the BR had cold handle faucet that wouldn't turn off. It would just spin around. So you had to have it just right for the water to stop. 
The toilet in the other bathroom leaked slowly onto the floor. 
The garage door opener worked but it wouldn't engage the door itself. In other words, we couldn't use the garage. When it was 80+ degrees, would have been nice to get the cars out of the sun. 
So all of the above were minor in nature & owner needs to address but nothing that we were so upset with that we needed a service call. It's the little things in life that we didn't stress over. But these things need to be fixed. 
Finally we come to the pool & the hot tub. When we arrived, the water level in the pool was approx. 12-15"" low. Low enough in fact that the pool would not heat because it fell below the skimmer. There were garden hoses on either side of the pool which we used to refill the water. Took a good number of hours to refill that much water and get the heater to come on. 
The hot tub was also about 8-9"" low. Since it only held 4 people, fast to refill. 
But we learned that you cannot heat the pool & the hot tub at the same time. Maybe that is how all pool heaters work, but it was a pain to heat the pool for hours, then we had to turn that off & then heat the HT.
Finally every morning we had to refill the HT. It was bone-dry. The pump would come on and shoot water everywhere. We had to refill that everyday. That was a terrible inconvenience.
Lastly, there are ungodly amount of light switches. It would be nice to label them ALL. 
Nice visit but has to be better than this for the cost

TITLE: 
disappointing! bugs, mould, run down!
REVIEW: 
We stayed at this property for a week in Dec of 2022. The house was spacious and in a nice gated community, unfortunately this house was very dated and smelled like wet dogs.

When we arrived the pool area was very dirty, chairs were all over the place. The “games room” was in the garage, although it was piled with garbage, broken chairs, broken Lamps, old tarps and a broken dishwasher. No one wanted to use this space. It should not be advertised as a games room, but rather a dumping ground. 

The dishwasher and cabinet under sink has bugs in it, there was mould all over the water dispenser on the fridge. The frying pans were old nasty Teflon pans, all the Teflon peeling off. I can’t believe they expect people to cook on these pans. The plastic spoons were from the dollar store, very poor quality and a number of them broken or melted.

The pool had a broken cover on the bottom of the pool. My son stepped on it while swimming and cut his toe very deep. 

The washing machine and dryer knobs were super sticky and insanely loud. 

The bed in the master bedroom was sloping off to one side so badly I get like I was falling out of bed every night. The mattress in one of the room upstairs was broken as well. Beds were hard not at all comfortable.

The community facilities are nice, although you need a card to access them and there was no access card left for us. When I messaged the owner the number he gave me was an incorrect number for management. I had to talk to a number of different People to get a card, and couldn't get one until the last day of our stay. 

There was very strict policy on garbage removal which threatend high fines of up to $500 if not followed correctly. Although through out the home there was 4 different notes all dictating different instructions, and conflicting garbage days. 

One of the kitchen chairs was broken, the can openers were dirty and rusty and impossible to use. Window blinds broken. The dishwasher door falls like a brick down on your toes when you open it up. We think it broke my husbands toe. 

A number of these items were dangerous and caused my family bodily harm. I let the owner know and requested a discount for our stay. He just blamed the management crew and said there was nothing he could do.

Overall I have never been so disappointed with a Vrbo, all of our other stays have been fantastic. I am concerned about someone getting hurt with the run down nature of this home. I would not recommend staying here due to safety issues and misleading advertising about the games room and the community pool.

Upon glass on the floor broken. arrival, a large window in the main living space was broken- really broken - like glass on the floor still broken. It was obvious someone had been out to slap a piece of plywood on it but there was a considerable draft , glass on the floor and in the crevices of the fireplace and NO dustpan to be found for clean up. It was snowing and about 18 degrees. I immediately started calling the management company but after remaining on hold for 20 minutes which was enough time to hear the timbertop jingle enough times to memorize it! I went and bought a dust pan at the local store , placed some plastic wrap over the window and shoved a chair against it to help with the draft since we had babies and small children arriving. . I tried to contact the property manager by email and was unable to contact anyone that way either. One of the King size beds was actually a double. The refrigerator looked like someone tool a shot gun to it, The lampshade in the living room was shredded. The 4 ammenities -hot tub,- (smelled funky) pool(slimy bottom), pool table (no tips on sticks- no chalk) and theater room(would not connect to surround sound) all had issues. We were missing an entire shower curtain in one of the bathrooms, the dryer didn't dry(heating element?) and a towel rack promptly fell off the wall when a towel was applied. I was able to contact the company the second night of our stay and they sent someone out the 3rd night. We did not get into the pool until the 3rd night after he had been and gone so I didn't report it until checkout. I asked to be called by a manager who did call 2 days later and was very apologetic. After hearing the issues they offered less than 10% discount for our trouble. This was not the luxury cabin experience our family Christmas celebration was expecting .

REVIEW: 
I always like to give good reviews but this time, it was just too much. Although the condo appeared clean, it was infested with roaches. We killed at least 10 and the last morning when we got up before the sun and turned on the lights they were everywhere!!! Running inside the toilet bowl, in the kitchen sink, dozens of them running across the floors, it made me sick just thinking about them being in our food, clothes and beds! Also the first night our toilet was slow, by morning it wouldn't flush. We called Vacasa as directed and someone came within a couple of hours but was unable to fix it, he came back around 5:30 on Friday night to pick up his stuff and said he couldn't fix it and a plumber would have to come. I asked when he would be here and he said "" I don't know, it's Friday night so I don't know if he will come tonight"". He did not return that night nor the remainder of the trip, we never heard from anyone and when I sent a text message as directed I got a generic response saying no one was available at this time. We spent the remainder of the trip all having to share one bathroom. I spent an outrageous amount of money for 3 nights at the condo as a Christmas gift to my mom and daughter so that we could enjoy a special time together only to be disgusted, embarrassed and frustrated by the entire vacation. We've stayed at many VRBO type places and always had excellent experiencs, this was extremely disappointing. I sent a message stating I would like to speak to someone about my concerns however, as of today I have yet to hear from anyone. I am not the type of person to complain and I can overlook alot of things including a couple of bugs, but this was over the top when there are dozens of bugs and a toilet that never worked. I hope someone will contact me soon.

TITLE: 
nightmare
REVIEW: 
We booked a house on the beach with a heated pool and spa. When we got there everything seemed clean the house was nice and as advertised. Within an hour we saw a cockroach and another one came up the drain as I was brushing my teeth and they were big! I sent a message out to Vacasa who only would respond by text and klept saying we will reach out to our team and get back to you. Someone from the team the next day reached out via text and told us he saw a roach the day before we checked in but they were palmettos and they were outside bugs and non invasive. I understand Floridians call their roaches that. They were most definitely cockroaches and many of them. He said he would order an extra spray but couldn’t get anyone there until Tuesday and we checked in on Saturday due to a holiday weekend. Still no word on Tuesday after reaching out to them many times, buying our own roach traps and spray, containers for our food, many nights of no sleep, constantly killing and watching for roaches. Wednesday the exterminator showed up and told us that we had a bigger problem and there was a leak in the plumbing and that they were coming up the drains from the sewer. He told us what we needed to do and boil water and pour it down the drains amongst getting a plumber. Mind you this is our vacation rental and we informed him we are on vacation not our house. Later that night we got a text from the local crew that we needed to switch houses due to “the bigger issue” and we would get some level of compensation. We were moved to another house not on the beach, the pool wasn’t heated and the neighbors hated having vacationers in the neighborhood and had protest signs in their yards. Long story short we also paid for heated pool it wasn’t heated or clean and they told us to clean it. They said we would be reimbursed for the pool not being heated. We moved houses, no reimbursement for the no heated pool or the stay with the infested house of roaches. Overall we had a horrible vacation and no compensation for anything NEVER will go to another Vacasa home again. Horrible!

Pros - nice infinity swimming pool, close to the beach, great views of the beach & sea, many bars/restaurants to choose from in the downtown core

Cons - Arrived Saturday night, had great difficulty finding a driving route to the property, as many roads in the area were closed off (which is a nightly occurrence). It would’ve been nice to have known this beforehand, and given driving instructions to bypass the numerous road closures. Very noisy locale, given the many bars and in the area - music was blaring till 2 AM every night. The room suite itself was OK, but dated. Barbeque was rusted and ancient. Glass range cooktop was significantly damaged with very large cracks in the surface (a small, portable electric burner was provided). The built-in microwave was also not working (a small, portable microwave was also provided). As is common with other resorts and condominium properties, finding a poolside lounge chair can be daunting if you’re not up early and reserving one for yourself (even though you are instructed not to reserve a chair and leave it for an hour or more, nobody follows that rule…and on-site security doesn’t enforce it).

misleading description of beds and filthy dirty carpet and fans!
REVIEW: 
I booked and paid for a two bed, two and a half bath condo for 4 adults, one couple and two other adults, so we needed 3 beds. The third bed listed in the description of the property a sofa sleeper/futon bed which I planned for my adult children to take turns sleeping on. We arrived at the property at 1AM on Sunday morning. Imagine my surprise and disappointment when the couch and chair in the living room were neither sleeper sofas nor futons and were not big enough for a 10 year old child to sleep on much less a full grown adult! I found a phone number for the host and texted him asking if we had been given the wrong condo as I was very specific with him prior to our trip that we needed a third bed. He never once said that the 3rd bed was an air mattress that needed to be blown up after we arrived, but this is what he texted me in the wee hours of the morning after we arrived! I could not even find the mattress until the next morning as the closet where it was stored was in a bedroom where my son had already gone to bed. I found the mattress the next morning and when I blew it up the air rushed out through a giant hole in the seam! I called the host and he insisted that it was standard that the 3rd bed was an air bed...never disclosed on VRBO, much less expected when you are booking a vacation property as opposed to an Air B and B. Later that day he had Instacart drop off a new bed. The new bed needed batteries in order to use the pump provided with the bed, however the batteries were not included...stated right on the front of the box..batteries not included! Meanwhile, I filed a complaint with VRBO about the bait and switch in the property description. They finally agreed to rebook us in a different property, but only if the host cancelled our current booking! I went back and forth via text with the host insisting he cancel our booking and he refuseed. I requested he at least refund the cleaning and service fees and he still refused. He then started referring to the fourth person in our party as an ""extra guest"". I booked and paid for 4 adults and specifically requested accommodation with 3 beds. I was never once told the third bed would be an old air mattress with a giant hole in it! The carpet throughout the unit is filthy dirty, the ceiling fans were filthy dirty , the stove and microwave were either really dirty of damaged, there was a giant smear of greas on the cabinet over the microwave. There were holes in walls and dents in doors

This property overall was a bit of a disappointment because we were told that the original house we had booked had water or electricity damage so we had chose another. This house is very eccentric indeed and quite outdated which made it feel quite dusty and grimy. We will not be dealing with Algarve Vacations in future. It was ridiculous that we had to pay extra to use a baby cot and high chair (after we were made to change houses!). In addition, 130 euros of our deposit was not returned for some coffee stains on sheets that apparently wouldn't come out in the wash. We have no way of knowing if they tried and no way of disputing it to try to get the money back.

amazing ocean-front view from spacious balcony
REVIEW: 
This is an older condo with older furniture and amenities but nicely kept. We enjoyed our 10 day stay. Fish Market across the street with fresh caught fish daily. Food truck court just down the street was fun. Other small eateries and coffee shops within walking distance. Grass area with beach chairs/lounges with the waves pounding the wall in front of you. The unit's location to beachfront is hard to beat.
However, here are some observations about the condo. 
The photographer did an amazing job of making the unit look twice the size it actually is. 
Balcony and living areas are comfortable and spacious compared to the rest of the unit.
Bathroom area with shower is small but adequate for two people, not more. 
Kitchen is very small but has a full size range and microwave. No oven, but we didn't go there to make Thanksgiving dinner! Small toaster oven is provided but would not fit even a small pizza. Cooking utensils were minimal. Not many drinking glasses, especially plastic ones for the beach.
Bedroom featured a king-size captain's bed that filled the room. If you are shorter than 6 feet tall or have trouble climbing and jumping you might have trouble getting into the bed. My wife is 5 feet tall and I had to pull her into bed each night. It is comfortable once you are in it, but hard to get into. Very little room to move around the bed. We had to move a couple of items out of the room to make it easier to get around the bed. Closet is adequate size with hangers and shelves, and the captain's bed has large drawers that pull out for storing items, but they are hard to access because of how close the bed is to the walls.
Laundry facilities were easy to use and located on all levels except the first level.
Getting to the small beach in front of the break wall was difficult due to damaged stairways on both ends of the property. The damage, likely from storms, is bad enough that the stairs are fenced off. Access to the beach is by climbing down the 4-5 foot wall made of lava rock, not something everyone will be able to do. A short walk north along the street takes you to a nice public access beach where you can spend the day or just walk back through the tidepools to the front of the Paki Maui property.
Pool area was nicely outfitted with gas grills. Spa was warm and comfortable. Pool is not heated so it was not comfortable to be in (we visited in January) unless you are from Minnesota, in which case you would probably love it!
Several maintenance items had been overlooked and we hope they are repaired for the next visitor (all reported to property manager). Bathroom sink drained painfully slow. Kitchen faucet was wobbly and not properly attached to the counter top. Microwave control buttons for lights/fan were loose and hard to operate. Towel rack inside shower had been previously broken and poorly repaired requiring us to continually put it back in place.
Again, overall we enjoyed ou stay at Paki Maui but found the attention to detail for a property priced at this level to be lacking. Next visit we would choose a different property. We hope this helps those considering this unit.

Stayed here for a weekend with friends. The house could use some TLC, but the picture windows, lake view, hot tub and multilevel deck more than compensated for the less-than-perfect interior. The inside is comfortable—great room upstairs was an excellent “hangout” spot and the pool and football tables downstairs were fun. It was fairly clean but did have some cobwebs in corners and dust bunnies/crumbs under beds. Some finishing touches that would make it better: trash cans in all bathrooms, fix loose towel racks, put handles/knobs on all kitchen cabinets (especially under sink), paint the spots where drywall has been patched, consider some basic instructions for use of kitchen appliances, TV and gas fireplace. But overall, we had a nice time here and there was plenty of room for 4 couples.

While the property itself has many good features, presents nicely and the property managers responded quickly to problems as they arose, we were confronted with a number of concerning issues which we spent valuable holiday time dealing with quite apart from the total inconvenience of the maintenance failures eg the dishwasher failed on the first usage & leaked into the downstairs (dishwasher hose & associated electrics- rodent damage), 3 beds at least did not have fresh sheets and had sand etc in them (too late at night to involve property managers), batteries to 2 fans needed replacing and fire alarm battery needed replacing after dishwasher leak.
TITLE: 
a holiday home with potential (with more attention to maintenance).
REVIEW: 
We recently rented this property for a family of 7. While the property itself has many good features, presents nicely and the property managers responded quickly to problems as they arose, we were confronted with a number of concerning issues which we spent valuable holiday time dealing with quite apart from the total inconvenience of the maintenance failures eg the dishwasher failed on the first usage & leaked into the downstairs (dishwasher hose & associated electrics- rodent damage), 3 beds at least did not have fresh sheets and had sand etc in them (too late at night to involve property managers), batteries to 2 fans needed replacing and fire alarm battery needed replacing after dishwasher leak. The one upstairs toilet had a very unpleasant & obvious smell. The downstairs ensuite accommodation (a room off the converted garage) does not have an opening window in the bedroom or a fan, the nearby kitchenette could at least provided glasses for water- it is totally empty of any utensils. Not really a pleasant alternative space for grandparents!

The location, property layout and unit layout were all good. All as advertised. The property has dated and worn carpet, both showers, both shower fans, both bath faucets and vanities (vanity doors partially off the hinges in the master). Most concerning, some electrical outlets (Behind the master bed) were internally broken, loose and not fully functional. Seemed a bit hazardous. No ice trays, icemaker not functional, etc. 

Were charged an extra resort fee but the hot tub wasn't working.

die location ist einer der besten in corralejo. ruhig, aber nah zum einkaufs/party-meile & strand.
REVIEW: 
++ Internet schnell und relativ leicht einzurichten. Alle 5 Geräte konnten über WiFi verbunden werden und hatten gleichzeitig Zugang zum Internet.
++ Einchecken auch um 12:00 möglich. War positiv überrascht, wie schnell wir die Schlüssel bekommen haben.
++ In 10 Tagen 2 Mal Putzkolone.
+ Relativ nah an Strand. Man kann morgens mit den Surf-Nomaden hin und abends zurück
+ Beten sind stabil und sauber. Wir konnten ohne Rückenschmerzen gut schlafen.
+ Die große Elektrogeräte in der Küche sind relativ neu und funktionell
+ Es gibt tatsächlich 3 Schlafzimmer und keine der 6 Personen muss im Wohnzimmer auf dem Sofa schlafen. (Wie andere Inserate in diesem Region die Anzahl der Schlafplätze gerne übertrieben)
+ Das Haus ist Alarm gesichert.
o Der Tisch und die Stühle in der Küche sind viel neuer als die alte Einbauküchenelemente (IKEA machts möglich)
o Müllentsorgungskonzept relativ OK. Mann muss 100m zu Fuß zum Container (Glas, Plastik/Verpackung, Papier, Hausmüll)
o Küche ist mit Allem nötigen für 6 Personen ausgestattet
o Es gibt (wie im meisten Ferienhäuser) keine Garderobe im Flur oder in der Diele. Man hat aber reichlich Platz für Sofa und Sessel.
o Die Klopapierhalter sind magnetisch und schwergängig aber funktionieren. Bitte vorsichtig öffnen, weil jemand schon die Dübel aus der Wand gerissen hat.
- Die Kühlschranktür wurde mit Anschlag-Rechts montiert statt Links. Der Kühlschrank erlaubt eine Montage mir dem Türanschlag links und so wäre es auch viel einfacher gewesen etwas aus dem Kühlschrank zu holen und auf dem Tisch zu stellen.
- Tor funktioniert nicht. Man kann mit dem Auto nicht auf den Hof.
- Wanduhr in der Küche funktioniert nicht
- Der Wasserkocher leckt Wasser
- Lüfter im Badezimmer funktioniert nicht
- Insektenschutz gab einmal, jetzt ist an allen Fenstern kaputt.
- Die Fenster sind schwergängig und relativ verrostet.
-- Die Einbauküchenmöbel fehlt auseinander. Die Hängeschränke verlieren ihre Unterrahmen, die Laminierung der Fachböden und Seitenwände kommt ab, die Arbeitsplattenleiste hat sich von der Wand gelöst. 
--- Kakerlaken im Haus (~2cm groß). Nachdem ich unter der Eibauküchenschränke hinter Lippenleiste gründlich den jahrelangen Dreck geputzt habe und lebendige/tote Insekte entfernt habe, gab es keine weitere Begegnungen. Wir haben die Leiste, während unseres Aufenthalts nicht mehr angebracht damit sich keine Viecher sich einnisten können.

REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS. We had a 7 month old baby with us and had to leave because of the safety concerns and the absolutely putrid rancid smell (we could not even sleep in the bedroom it was that bad)
I use Airbnb all the time and have NEVER had a an issue or bad experience and I always leave hosts glowing reviews. I will never be using vrbo again - this was an awful property that was unmaintained and unrepresented. I really hope this doesn’t happen to anyone else - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

REVIEW: 
We arrived late at night to check in with our kids who already fell asleep on the drive there. After we opened the doors to this unit, the smell of ammonia slapped us in the face. There were air fresheners everywhere but they only seemed to make the odor worse. We then realized the ammonia odor was from rat urine. We found rat droppings and rat traps in the kitchen. The rat traps were hidden under the sink, but the rat droppings were not hidden at all. We had to leave the unit immediately. The owner texted me that he would issue a full refund, but never did. No one should EVER have to go through what our family went through with Golan, owner of Saba Housing.

Be AWARE!!! This unit has RATS! We stayed for one night and were woken up and forced to leave the unit at 4am due to rats in our bag and eating our food that we brought for our trip. There were Rat droppings that littered the area, which we overlooked when initially checking in and assumed as dirt and debris. We informed the Host Kim and Tim who offered to compensate us for the inconvenience of having to leave abruptly as a result of their Rat infested unit. It has been over a week and the host has not communicated back or compensated us as agreed upon. I have pictures of the Rat droppings and our snacks that were chewed through. I also have the correspondence from the host where they agreed to fully compensate us. For this reason I WOULD NOT stay at this location for two reasons, 1) The host is not responsive or take responsibility for the health and safety of their guest and 2) being exposed to Rats and their fecal droppings.

REVIEW: 
Do not stay here if you have young kids crawling!!! 
Overall, the size of the house was perfect for our family. Amenities were great such as the hot tub, backyard, theater, but the overall cleanliness of the house was filthy. Our socks were black from the carpet and floors, trash was in the closets when we checked in, lots of trash in the garage, light bulbs out and not a lot of kitchen tools to cook things. What was disappointing was the heater stopped working during the night, which that night it got down to 20 degrees outside and the basement temperature was 63. For a child who just barely turned one that is a dangerous temperature to sleep in. Finally after the horrible management communication we were receiving a guy came out to look at the heater. He said it was clogged from something living in the house, maybe a mouse, bird something clogged the furnace, but he got the heater fixed after that. That next night while watching a movie in the theater we caught on camera a mouse in the kitchen. This is extremely dangerous with a child who is crawling and putting things in their mouth. I informed management about our overall stay and they didn’t care. Being a local to Cedar, wanting to support a family with this house so that our whole family could stay together, I would NOT stay here again or recommend to anyone with children. The heater and mouse were the icing on the cake. Very disappointed with our overall stay. Do not use this company or stay at this property unless you don’t care about cleanliness.

REVIEW: 
This place was infested with rodents and something had clearly died inside the walls, leaving the entire bottom floor with an absolutely PUTRID smell that made the place uninhabitable. We saw mice all over the place and droppings as well. The smell was so bad that we all felt nauseous and had to leave early and will be fighting for a refund. The smell of death and something rotting was making us all feel sick and like we couldn’t breathe. Too cold to keep the windows open. I stayed here for my birthday and the trip was ruined because of this irresponsible and unresponsive host. We lost money as well because we had to cut the trip short and had nowhere else to stay. We are SO disappointed to say the least. Do not be fooled by the photos, this place is not well cared for or maintained. The sauna doesn’t get very hot because there are massive holes and we didn’t/couldn’t even use the hot tub because of the intense chemical smell. This is a property that looks good on paper but should be avoided at all costs. I hope I can save you from having a trip like ours. I Informed the host about the problem and he did not care, was unapologetic, just said “yeah there are mice in the country” and then proceeded to ignore me. YOU SHOULD NOT CHARGE CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR A PLACE INFESTED WITH RODENTS.

We enjoyed our stay despite a few unfortunate things. The owner was extremely nice & communicative. I don’t think that she was aware of these things before our stay but I’m hoping she fixes the issues for future guests. The corner of the sectional sofa smelled like urine, there was mouse droppings in the kitchen drawers & the jets in the downstairs bathtub had so much sediment. Also the neighbors that are in front of the cabin have garbage bags of cans that are overflowing by a shed.

Summary:
While spacious with a good open main room and private picturesque setting, it was dirty and unhygienic, had insufficient cooling in the bedrooms, and a serious rat infestation. 
(Normally we give an owner a chance to fix any issues with direct, non-public feedback. This time we made a different decision to be public, to ensure accountability)

When we first arrived there were rat droppings in the living area, the kitchen and the bedrooms. Not sure how this got through “cleaning” as there were both fresh droppings and many that had clearly been there for quite some time. The rats came into the house every evening and left fresh droppings even though we left out no food. The rats repeatedly kept people awake with the noises as they knocked over and chewed non-food items. One evening when one bedroom door was closed the rats visibly chewed the carpets to get out of the bedroom under the doors. There were many unaddressed rat entry points as the ground level flyscreens were all chewed through (when we first arrived we opened the windows at night because there no was working air-conditioning in the bedrooms). After using the BBQ one evening the rats very quickly appeared on the BBQ itself before we had finished our meal (in daylight) – this was the only time that we saw the quite large rats. The owner had known about the rats before we arrived as he warned us about not leaving food out on our arrival day.

The place also had dust in many places including dust that brushed off curtains. There were stained and uncovered doonas, stinky blankets, active cobwebs and dead bugs throughout the living areas and bathrooms. The bathroom needed to be swept of bugs on arrival. Windows were dirty and smeared. This is a build up that the owners haven't bothered to deal with. One evening a cocoon/nest fell from the living room rafters onto the lounge. 

At least two bathroom doors would not latch and just blew open with a gentle breeze or with the rush of air as someone walked past.

A mother and child were stung by wasps, since – as we discovered - there was a large nest in a plant just outside the living room door on the deck. We later discovered another nest near the front door.

One air conditioning unit was broken and the “evaporative air conditioning” for the bedrooms was a complete waste of time.

gas leaks through out the property that were not fixed
REVIEW: 
We stayed in this rental January 20-23. We left a night early due to four natural gas leaks through out the property. We had to call Xcel which said the fireplace needed to be shut off immediately and fixed. One of the children staying in the house passed out and fell down the stairs due to the smell of the gas that is added to natural gas for detection. The management company said it was safe to stay in the property. They turned off the fireplace but did not address anything else. We had to call them. Not one of them called to see how we were or if they could help. And when we asked to leave a night early because we did not feel safe, they gave us a hard time because they insisted it was safe. They did not fix the leaks on the main floor which is where the bunk room is where all the kids were sleeping. We did not feel comfortable or safe staying. I called several days later to follow up and the leaks had not been fixed. The management company laughed when I expressed my frustration at the lack of concern. Would not recommend a management company that is in the business of booking a house that is unsafe. One of the maintenance guys that came while Xcel was inspecting said the property had received the same complaint and nothing was done.

REVIEW: 
I am sending in proof of an unsafe and dangerous home we rented from VRBO. I have proof that we had issues from the day we arrived on December 23, 2022. We were supposed to stay until January 2nd 2023. We arrived to find the back door broken and the kitchen full of snow and ice. Because the back door is broken the thermostat will not properly heat the home. The heat is escaping through the door. We immediately contacted the owner and she said she would send someone out on Monday and had no one for the next 3 nights because of Christmas. A space heater was dropped off for us and never offered to clean up the kitchen full of snow and ice or make a temporary fix for us till Monday. She refunded us $100 for inconvenience which did not even cover one night of our stay as we froze all weekend with 1 space heater and 2 floors in the home. On Saturday December 24,2022 my service animal fell down her stairs which are suspended hanging from ceiling with open wires. I will include pictures so you can understand the stairs and exposed wires. He got a deep puncture wound and was bleeding everywhere. We rushed him to the hospital on Christmas Eve which is where we spent Christmas. We drove 1500 miles to see family and could not. Notified the owner of the dangerous steps and situation and she did not respond. On Monday December 26, 2022 the contractor was promised to come out and fix door. A heating and cooling guy came because he was told by owner there was a gas leak. She NEVER told us about that. He said the door is broken and no contractor can fix it it needs a new door. I called VRBO and her immediately and no response till Tuesday December 27, 2022. She said she thought there was a gas leak weeks ago and had it checked. I asked her why would you send a guy back to check after you rented the home to double check for a gas leak? You should double check before you rent the home. Or notify us that it is possible and let us make decision whether or not we want to risk staying at the home. Never offered anything for the dog or how dangerous the steps are either but made sure to mention she paid a lot of money to have the steps built. We also lost WiFi. We rebooted the system several times to no avail. Called spectrum and they said NO OUTAGE in area the home has been disabled for private account reasons and the owner needs to call in. She denied that also. Spectrum accidentally told us the reason. VRBO has not resolved the issue. VRBO refunded us 322 which is from the company. The guest pays VRBO when booking. They did this as a courtesy. The homeowner lied and said she gave it. I verified with VRBO that the $322 comes from VRBO and is their money NOT HERS. She is a slum landlord who fixed up a property half to make money. The house is awful!! It is on a slant. The bathroom door does not even stay shut. The front door is not fitted to frame and you can see 1 to 2 inches under door to outside. Putting pictures of Louis Vuitton frames to entice people. DO NOT RENT THIS HOME unless you plan on ruining your vacation. The owner is a FRAUD! No matter what she comments about this trust me it is a lie!! 

We had to be moved to a hotel mid vacation. VRBO did not support me even after providing detailed documentation and pictures of the home. My dog was injured and my family’s life was put in danger. I had to file a dispute with my bank in order to receive my money back. I will NEVER use VRBO and I am sharing this info on Facebook to warn my family and friends of this incident and the lack of help this company provided. This host is allowed to continue renting a property that is unsafe and not secure with no repercussions. I have notified the town in which this home is located of the issues and they informed me also that this home has no BUILDING PERMITS for any improvements so nothing has been approved for safety and security. Very disappointed in VRBO. WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN 


FOLLOW UP! My bank did an investigation based on pictures and evidence I collected and they REIMBURSED me the money from this slum unsafe home THANK GOD!!

REVIEW: 
The trip started off just fine. Finding the dingy was not to hard. We got the motor fired up, loaded up the dingy & took the first load out to the boat. That took a little time to find but once you find it it was pretty easy. On our way back to shore the motor died, out of gas. Luckily it died at shore. We texted Isidora. She respond quickly & came out filled up the dingy with gas & we were on our way. Though this time the motor was not responding like it was when we first arrived. The main reason that we decided to stay on the boat was because she offered dingy & two kayaks that we could explore the mangroves with. But the motors not working correctly. Besides that the first night wasn't bad. The next day we get up & head into town to get some fishing gear & breakfast. That morning the motor was a pain to start. So I text her to try & get the motor fixed or to have the spare motor put on the dingy. She said her mechanic will be there around 12 or 1 to fix it. So we spend the morning buying fishing gear, having breakfast & exploring Key Largo. At 2, I reach out to her & she says that it should be good to go. We get back to the dingy it starts right up & we start taking off. To only have the motor die half way out to the boat. By this point we are stating to get annoyed with everything. So we limp it back to the boat. Once again I contact her & say that dingy is not working. She then says she will get her mechanic & will bring the other motor out & swap them. Perfect right, nope. By now its 2:45pm. She said she would just meet us at the boat with the mechanic to fix it. At 4pm she says that her mechanic is no where to be found so she needed us to limp the dingy back to shore, so we do. With no mechanic in sight we had to swap out the motor. Which normally we would not have a problem with that. But after today we are just over it. We get covered in gas/oil from the leaky motor. My buddy hurt his back from carrying the motor back to the car for her. So now it's our last day, we just spend the whole day messing around with the motor. Bought all of this fishing gear & its now 5pm & we just got back on the water. Also mosquitoes ate us ALIVE. She said that she would refund us for our troubles. We thought that was a very nice gesture. Since we left I have text her multiple times inquiring about the refund & no responses. She leaves my ""texts"" on read but thats it.

TITLE: 
great location -- not a comfortable stay
REVIEW: 
I'll start with the positive: the house is a great location. We went to ski @ Sugarbush and could not have been better. It recently snowed and the driveway was well plowed. The house had great hot water. Plenty of it. 

The challenges: the house has next to no privacy - bathrooms included. Even for adults the house has several safety issues. The stairs are too dark and not easy to negotiate. The kitchen was dirty, poorly stocked. No cold water at the kitchen sink. The fireplace could not be used. A ski house with a fireplace but you are told not to use it! The two doors on the first level to the outside cannot be locked! As a result it did not feel safe. 
The house had a persistent bad smell. There were several trash bags sitting outside the front door. I contacted the management co about this and the smell. The trash was picked up; but I did read in reviews that this has happened before. No one from the management co got back to me about the smell despite the fact that I told them that it may be a minor gas leak! 

The net is I would not stay here again.

TITLE: 
rental is very misleading and very poorly kept/managed
REVIEW: 
Summary: Overall a very poor experience. Extremely dirty, run down and many items broken. Host was very hard to get a hold of. The property had lots of issues that we later found out he was aware of prior to our stay but elected not to correct them. Would not stay their again. 

Pros: It does offer a good view of downtown Pigeon Forge (just don’t look down…I’ll explain more later)

Cons: 
- Entire property was covered with trash. You notice this right when you pull up. Trash around the front door, next to the steps and all down the hillside. Trash bags after trash bags just thrown down the mountainside. 
- Kitchen sink did work. Was finally fixed at the end of the second day. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Roof in the living room leaked when it rained creating big puddles in the living room/dining room (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Front door had dead bolt removed. Could only be locked by the weak door handle locked. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Very dirty. Tables and floors were sticky with old food and drink stains. Furniture had a lot of old food crumbs on/in them. Food all over in the movie room. (Host knew the cleaning crew wasn't doing a good job)
- Multiple games in the arcade room were broken. Golden Tee was completely broken and the basketball game was falling apart. (Host knew about this prior to our stay)
- Outdated and cheap items. Many of the kitchen cabinets were broken and had old junk stored in them. The kitchen utensils were extremely dirty and very cheap. 
- Grill was very dirty. So much so that we didn't feel comfortable grilling on it. Too rusty.
- Gas fire place had a small leak that causes the master bed to stick. We turned off the gas value to be safe. (Host knew about this)
- A bunch of random little things that all added up to bother us. Rusty nails found on the deck. Old paint cans sitting on the deck. Numerous light blubs burnt out. Dirty ash trays left out. Broken screens on the windows. Fire pit rusted out and covered with trash
- No extra supplies (trash bags, soap/shampoo/conditioner for the showers) Even the bathroom sink soaps were watered down.

Overall, a very poor experience. For the price we would not stay here again and I would strongly suggest you look for another rental if you are considering this one. Great area, we just got unlucky with a misleading description of the rental property and a bad host. Hope this review helps!

winter getaway
REVIEW: 
For the 10th year my family and friends convened in Estes Park for a weekend of concerts and the lodge was an absolutely amazing home away from home for us. 
Everyone enjoyed their rooms, the great showers/bathrooms and the wonderful kitchen area (I may be stealing some ideas from that awesome island for my kitchen rebuild soon)
There was a huge consensus about the desire to return to the house for future trips.

There was an issue with a smell in the downstairs kitchen/bunkbed area the first morning. I called the property manager a couple times and left messages about it before we figured out it was tied to hot water use. When my call was returned the evening of the next day I was informed that it was a normal occurrence when the property has been vacant for a bit of time related to water system drainage. By that time the smell had stopped occurring and our initial concerns that it was a small gas leak were alleviated.

As above. 5mins walk to beach across the road. We had dinner on the deck most nights. I advise replacing all the nails in the deck with stainless steel screws before they become a trip or injury hazard. They are all ""popping"" and hammering them down again will not prevent this. It is caused by the timber shrinking and swelling.

beautiful views, quiet location, light-filled spacious property
REVIEW: 
The house is spectacularly situated for a sweeping view of the water and sky. It is mostly windows so the light is fantastic. There is plenty of room for spreading out inside: a large great room, open kitchen with everything you need, and beds are comfortable. We had a great stay, and the owner was responsive when we called with reports of two malfunctioning doors. On the less positive side: the deck and outside portions of the house show wear and neglect: moss is growing on much of it, with debris and green slick on others, some rotted boards, and a railing that fell off during out stay. The lights in the house are hard to figure out, and the fading magic marker scrawlings on the faceplates add no charm. The lower level storage space is messy, and we found a “surprise” in one of the drawers upstairs. A little more attention to detail and this will be a fantastic property.

REVIEW: 
· Although it did not have air-conditioning, there is insufficient fans to cool the property adequately. Three rusty old fans were an insufficient source of cooling – the house felt was extremely uncomfortable on warmer days/nights.
· No window screens on the majority of windows. To cool the property it was necessary to open windows. This caused security concerns and also allowed insects into the property.
· Every window blind in the house was broken and would not function properly.
· Security screen doors could not be locked causing further security issues.
· No storage area to store bikes etc unless they were brought inside although, due to no functioning security screens and the requirement to leave windows open (with no screens) security of bikes etc was a concern.
· Backyard unsuitable for children to play in – zero shade
· Back deck unsafe and in need repair/re-build – exposed nails extremely deteriorated timbers.
· Lattice around back deck is rotten and falling apart – our dog kept going under the deck which caused some issues leaving toys etc underneath.
· The bunk beds swayed and did not feel structurally safe.
· Advertisement states the house is “basic” and “humble” – This is an strong understatement!
· Fantastic fridge – the kids loved the ice maker.
None of the photos on the website show what state the property is actually in. Very disappointing.

Photos are deceiving. Outdoor shower rusted and falling apart used as storage. Camper for additional guest you could see dead insects and junk inside nobody could ever stay in there. Electrical was suspect with melted electrical outlets. Furniture dirty and from the 1980’s. Landscaping was let go with overgrown weeds and rusty pool screening and green pool to look at every day. Dock is dilapidated. Kayaks were both broken down with broken seats and in poor condition. SUP was not provided. Upper deck seemed unsafe with ancient furniture. Really low class. Do not plan on cooking just not feasible in the kitchenette. This is a 120.00 a night VRBO not 220 that we paid. Also the owners are right there every day, they never go anywhere, so there is no privacy at all. The owners are all nice enough (4 adults). They just seem unable to do any kind of work or maintenance on the property. I just want future renters to know what to expect if they choose to rent.

The property is in a lovely location and is a good size. But requires a bit of maintenance, with leaking shower heads and no drains in the bathrooms for the water. Also unsafe balcony rails, loose glass panels and loose cables from faulty work. The lock box for the property key was corroded up, also some sliding doors wouldn't slide or would fall of their rails.
The property is also like two separate residences as it's not very interconnected.
Finally was advertised as both a 6 bedroom and a 4 bedroom by Stayz which was very confusing 😕.

As soon as I opened the door I was great with an overwhelming musty mold order that permiated through every room of the home. A few of the beds had bedding with multiple stains on both sides. The worse stain appeared to be blood. There were cobwebs in the corners of the room. One of the kids woke up with what appeared to be a spider bite. There was a thick build up of dust on the ceiling fans. The air filter was dirty. The pool table was gross. The ping pong table, net, and one of the paddles were broke. One of the closet doors were off sitting inside closet. Some of the tv's did not have remotes. This booking was beyond a dissapointment. Worse experience to date. I have several pics to share.

REVIEW: 
There’s a bed bug infestation. Stayed 2 nights. The first morning I had a few welts which I wanted to believe were mosquito bites but it’s January; mosquitoes are dead. Never saw a single mosquito. Second and final morning the welts were all over my torso and sides. I supplied the owner with photos of the numerous bites I experienced and she said she’d have an exterminator inspect the place for bed bugs and get back to me. Now she has stopped communicating. If you’re still reading….unfortunately the other reviews are accurate. Many windows are lacking blinds including the French doors in the kitchen and the entire game room which cannot be closed off bc there’s no door. The blinds in the master bedroom, master bath and living room are broken in a way that anyone can see in. Basically the entire house can be seen from the outside from multiple vantage points. The neighborhood is very sketchy. After dark the entire back doors (glass) are completely exposed to the back yard and neighbors and anyone who wants to see inside. Only the back door keypad was working until it malfunctioned late at night and I found myself locked out trouble shooting via text with the owner. She refuses to have actual conversations. The other reviews are correct: roach motels and roach bait in all cabinets and drawers. Had to wash all dishes prior to using them and after since you have to start the dishwasher, strip linens and take out the trash prior to leaving. Not sure what the high cleaning fee is for if you’re the one cleaning. The hot tub water was cloudy and the jets barely worked on one side. This is a tired, dirty, bed bug infested property in a bad neighborhood. Do not under any circumstances book this place.

We booked this condo before hurricane Ian caused so much damage to the Gulf Coast. Anne Marie was fantastic in communicating the condition and repairs on and around the condo area and because of her we kept our reservation. This condo has so many things going for it. The furnishings are all perfect - clean and in great shape - no wear or stains. The mattress is amazingly comfortable and the sheets are quality! The dishwasher is by far the quietest that we have ever encountered in a rental. The screened in deck showcased fantastic sunrises and had the advantage of shade in the late afternoon. The kitchen was well appointed with nice cookware, dishes and a nice variety of basic spices and coffee. There is not a washer/dryer in the unit but it is a short distance from the condo to the coin machines on the very same floor and detergent is furnished for a load or two. The rainfall shower is wonderful and spacious and there were plenty of amenities for soap/shampoo/conditioners and plenty of clean towels. We did not go to the beach, but there is a great supply of beach items if you choose to go. We did run into a bit of updating that had been delayed due to the hurricane, but it was nothing that the owners had control of and they were so very helpful as we worked our way though that. We had a wonderful and warm week - thank you!

REVIEW: 
Pat's at Punaluu is located on a beautiful stretch of beach, perfect for snorkeling. Unfortunately the ongoing construction, which we were told ahead of our stay would be only a minor disturbance. In fact we found out that the sewage treatment is under repair. When we pulled up to the property for our stay a sewage truck was blocking the parking lot, emptying the sewer lines for the building. The second night, in the middle of the night the stench of sewer gas was so strong in our room that our eyes were watering and our infant began coughing. We had to move onto the sofa near the balcony to sleep. Ultimately do you safety concerns, we had to evacuate the property the next morning, cutting short our week long stay by 5 nights and having to find a hotel at the last minute. We called the property manager to inquire about the overpowering sewer gas smell, and he readily acknowledged that the sewage treatment on the property was broken and was an ongoing issue. We believe that the property should not be rented out to other unsuspecting families until the construction of the sewage handling is completed.

We (a family group of 5) had a wonderful time at this beachfront condo in New Smyrna Beach. The sounds of the waves, long walks on the beach, and cool breezes were a perfect break between two theme park visits. The interior is just as the photos depict and the kitchen is well-stocked with tea & coffee and the leftovers from previous visitors (don't buy olive oil -- there are at least 3 bottles).

mixed review
REVIEW: 
I appreciate reviews, take them into consideration, and therefore feel I should also provide them for others. This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.
A couple of hours later, she and another gal showed up with a new tv. They did not know how to hook it up and called a third gal from the office who came over when she could get away. She got the new tv working. I did not ask for any refund but I did ask the manager during that time if THEY offered any rebates to partially compensate for a trip as full of annoyances as this one. I just made the point that I had spent over $6000 to fly to Marco to rest and the 8 days had been anything but restful. She replied that none of this was anyone’s fault and she’d have to ask the owner about any rebate. I said thank you, please do that. As she left my unit, I reiterated, please let me know what the owner says and she said she would. I never heard another word from her.
She did also tell me that they couldn’t haul the old tv off and she would leave it and the box trash on our front porch for someone to come get. When we left 5 days later, all that trash was still setting there.

During the next 5 days, I was briefly stuck on the small elevator that goes to the upper private parking level. No call button on that elevator worked. We parked our car on the lower level and used the main elevator or the stairs. On the last day, packing to leave, we had suitcases and boxes and bags to ferry from the 4th floor to the first floor parking garage. This time my friend got stuck on the main elevator which then quit working completely. He escaped and called the Esplanade management company number posted on the elevator. That guy sounded unconcerned, yeah, we’ve been having some elevator trouble, I’ll call Otis again, blah, blah, blah. Don’t you think you should put a sign on the elevator so people will know, we asked. Oh, I’ll just cut off the circuit breaker when I get a chance to get over there, he said. (Sure hope no one was on it.) And we’re not kids but we could climb up and down 8 flights of stairs; everyone may not be able to do that.

Summary: Did we enjoy our visit? Yes of course because we don’t let stuff steal our joy and I do think our unit property folks tried at times and I also know stuff happens. But I’ve stayed at Esplanade twice before in two different units in the past few years. I loved the first two visits and can recall only experiencing one issue which was resolved satisfactorily in 10 minutes. The property is still beautiful, the restaurants are great, and the view is just stunning.
But I spent way too much money and time this trip to be wrangling problems I can face at home for free.

mixed review
REVIEW: 
I appreciate reviews, take them into consideration, and therefore feel I should also provide them for others. This one is a toughie. So much good, so much annoying. 
We arrived on Sat afternoon and were told that the Wifi was not working, and that the provider was coming later in the day to repair it and were asked would we be there. We would not.
So we kept our plans and when we got to our place later that afternoon there was no Wifi, no repairman, and in fact no tv service. We called our property manager who said the repairman might come Sun or Mon or Tues but she’d come over to fix the tv. She came, couldn’t fix it. We were provided a “hot spot” for intermediate, slow internet. While she was there, we showed her kitchen lights that were blinking; she said they were old.
So Sat, Sun, Mon, Tues – no tv and no internet except for the hot spot which quit working by Tues. There were some ballgames during these dates that we really wanted to see and prop mgr arranged for us to walk two doors down and watch the tv in that property. I thanked her.
On Tues, we were asked if we’d be onsite since the repairman was coming for sure. We agreed to stay put. He did come after more calls, complaining about lack of instruction on how to access the property, but at least we were back in business.
On Wed, the tv got so hot, I turned it off and unplugged it, called prop mgr again who said the tv needed replacing and she would get it done soon. I thanked her.
On Thurs, I followed up, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I thanked her.
On Sat, I followed up again, she said she had messaged the owner and expected to hear something right away. I said, this is exactly what you told me two days ago. And then I elaborated, reminding her that I had paid over $6000 for 13 nights, spent a fair amount of time dealing with stuff that doesn’t work, including a tv that had worked for 1 day out of the 8 we had been there so far.

TITLE: 
great spot to stay
REVIEW: 
Listing was very accurate to the apartment reserved for our weekend trip. The apartment was great for two people. Any more then two-three people and you will feel crowed. The apartment was clean but we did find vomit in the hallway right outside out door.

Check in process was a bit confusing at first, lucky I travel for work a lot and was able to figure out the elevator/door codes and where to go. The parking garage was confusing at first but were able to figure that all out. It was very difficult to exit the garage at night due to the valet from a restaurant blocking most the exit. 

But that elevator.. We would enter the code and would start moving to our floor then the door would not open and would send us back down to whichever floor had just hit the elevator button. It happened three separate times to the point we stopped using the elevator for fear it would trap us in. 

I have been to Nashville for many weekend trips and will keep this location in mind for the next trip.

This property is about 10 minutes to the beach which is very convenient. The condo itself is dingy, dirty, and very outdated. The walls are scuffed up, outlets are starting to become a fire hazard, and there was hair in the tub from previous renters.

TITLE: 
relaxing stay on brewers bay
REVIEW: 
Brewers Bay Beach House is a perfect location for those looking for peace and quiet in a Caribbean Tropical setting. Nestled right on a secluded beach, you may not see another human being during your stay... which is exactly what the doctor ordered for those like us wishing to escape the hustle and bustle of city/suburban life for a little R&R. 

Brewers Bay is one of the least crowded bays on Tortola, and it is beautiful. As the pictures show accurately, it is right on the water... lots of toys and a nice reef to snorkel, right in front of the house. 

Things to do... 
- we rented a Suzuki Jimney - you WILL need this to access the property as the roads are sketch... we picked it up right at the ferry dock upon our arrival (Island Time Car Rentals)
- drive to the West End Ferry Dock and catch a 15 min ferry to Jost Van Dyke for 4 hours... rent a Jimney there and take the ""road less travelled"" over the top of the mountains (NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART!)... see the ""bubbly pool"" (don't forget your bathing suit)... on Beautiful White Bay take 5 mins to get a Painkiller at the Soggy Dollar (where it was invented) and then leave immediately and go next door to eat at Hendos (a much nicer establishment with better food)
- We ate at all the best restaurants on the Island... Best of the Best: Marche at Trellis on Beef Island - incredible Poke Bowl and Sushi Rolls! Sugar Mill Hotel - setting to die for. Dragon Fly Lounge for Lunch. French Deli for coffee / pastries / wine / rum / baguette sandwiches. Brandywine Estate - what a view!
- Drive to Beef Island and take the 20 min ferry ride one day to Virgin Gorda and the Baths... suggest eating at Marche at Trellis at 1130 - right by the ferry dock - take the 100pm to Virgin Gorda... $99 car deal gets you 2 round trip ferry tickets and a rental car for the day... 130 arrival and hit the Baths... then head to Little Dix Bay around 430 (Rosewood Resort) and rinse off in their outdoor beach shower, change into a sundress and polo with light slacks and loafers (no sandals allowed!) have a drink at the RUM Bar, and dine at 6PM at the Reef Restaurant at the resort... then take the 8PM (5 mins away) ferry back to Tortola. Little Dix Bay resort is amazing and worth a visit - grab a bike at the visitor's parking lot!
- Rent a boat (with or without a skipper) at Island Time an take the 20 min ride to The Indians for the best snorkeling in the VBI

A wonderful VACAY in a magical place!

Had an amazing time with just a couple issues. First the hot tub had WAY too much chlorine, to the point we both ended up with chlorine rashes. Second was the grill ran out of propane while cooking second night. Gated community was extremely nice and we would stay again.
