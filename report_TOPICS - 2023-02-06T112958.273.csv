When we got there, the hot tub was not on at all, fire pit has no propane. Pool was dirty and wasnt on also. Not enough towels. The host was very fast at responsing to address it, it was address the next day, but we were only there for 2 nights, so that means the hot tub was never hot. Make sure you chat on VRBO app to be your proof if this happened to you and let VRBO know. This house has the potential to be a great house if it gives what it advertise. I gave it 4 star because of that or else its a 5 star."

You can see right through the entire home due to only having indoor/ out door blinds.. the hot tub was completely disgusting and green. Smelled like mildew and wasn’t even plugged in. Communication with staff trying to get someone out was ridiculous and took 18 hrs for someone to show up un announced . I drained and cleaned the hot tub myself. But it never even heated up fast enough for us to use. Neighbors window stay open and have zero privacy including that owner has a ring camera on the back door looking right at the hot tub. Wouldn’t book this house ever again. Absolute Waste of money."

Unit could use remodeling/updating its pretty run down but we don't stay indoors. Since this unit sleeps 6 there should be 6 of everything not only 4. Owner should purchase hangers and supply more in the kitchen however great communication. Wifi was terrible and only working in master bedroom area. Views were awesome and resort Ok. They are very strict on bringing coolers by pools and make you buy stuff there which is hefty however you can go to the beach. Bar was awesome great drinks and food but again pricey. Pools were pretty dirty when we were there tons of sand at the bottom. Check in process very friendly and smooth. Valet was great but expensive. Overall 3.5 rating. We will come again but more prepared. Cheers!"

The house needs some work:
Several blinds broken with this being the only window covering privacy can be a issue.
The last bedroom in the back of the house bed is terrible sunken in to the middle beds skirt ripped this bed needs replaced they tried just putting on a foam pad. The bathtub needs scrubbed you can scrape the sides and it's gross.
Loved having two washers and dryers they came in so handy with a large family who packed light.
Kitchen needs more frying pans other than that well equipped if you want to cook. 
Loved the grill we has a grill night.
The pool was dirty when we came but on Tuesday they did have the pool guy there and it was cleaned. 
The outdoor shower by the pool spigot is leaking.
The pool deck needs a lots of help and could be dangerous several broken pieces a few sticking up. 
We enjoyed the pool one day of our stay not very deep or big but was enjoyed 😀 👍.
Loved the outside table we all used this area often.
One of the chairs is broken on the inside table. Living room couch is a little dated. Loved that they had Netflix and Disney plus we had a two year old.
They had plenty of fans house does not have air-conditioning I was a bit worried but going in January the nights get a bit cooler days are hot but we we're gone most days. 
Lots of extra things in the closet off the living room some baby things toys, extra fans, each room has its own ceiling fan and had fans in the closet.
We loved all the extra thing like lawn chairs, umbrellas, ice chest, beach towels.
With a little bit of love this house could be brought back to life.
If you stay in the bedroom in the living room don't lock the door and the door to the bathroom no key was provided to us and we got locked out. Good thing it has a open space at the top 😉. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay finding a house with a decent price range for bigger families is hard and we appreciate you offering your home to people."

But the disappointment was the place. The building is very old. Looks dirty. There was rat poison pieces all over the building main floor. (We had to beware with our kids) The pool was dirty, my kids didn’t even want to go in. (5-7y) We took that condo to have the pool has an option. The condo in on the Main floor, we did not expect that. The balcony is in the yard with high concrete walls with spikes at top and a lot of garbage of construction laying around everywhere. So we did not use the balcony. The bathroom needs a facelift , the bath looked dirty and lots of rust on the poles. (The sea salt would be doing that ) But the rest of the apartment was clean. The location is the highlight of this stay, right across the street, the beach is there , with the popular tiki bikini hut right there. We were able to walk everywhere with our kids. The center is a few minutes away and the fish fry we went many times , 10 min walk. Bahamian people are really nice. Nassau is a great place, we loved it !"

The aircon is only in the living space and small upstairs tv room, so even though there were fans in bedrooms it was a bit hot and sticky, and if you aren't a big fan of sharing your space with nature you'll want to keep all the beautiful shutter glass windows closed, there are no fly screens on the main living area windows. But apart from those two technicalities we had a great time. When we arrived the pool was pretty dirty but it was because the vac had stopped working, and when i called they sent someone straight over and it was sorted super quick. They could do with a new manual pool cleaner, it had big holes in it so was a bit tricky cleaning stuff off the surface out. overall all, wonderful stay."

An SUV is a must since the roads are all dirt and have horrible dips. They only had a little car and we got 2 flat tires from the roads. We had no running water for 16 hours during the week. Then we had no power or water the last day we were trying to pack up to leave. The sofa was pretty dirty and you didn’t want to use. The shower head has such lower water pressure it’s hard to get all the shampoo and conditioner out so, I looked like a grease head the whole time. The pool was dirty when we arrived and after 8 days it was still never cleaned. There is a canopy over the pool which has large carabiners connection which was fine until the wind blows in the night and they are banging on the the roof all night long. There was weeks worth of bird poop on the deck in which we scrubbed for a while trying to clean because you couldn’t access the door way without stepping in it."

When we arrived the other guest apparently decided it was only their property and proceeded to have the tv on for the next eight hours at a level that can only make one assume they were born deaf and couldn’t afford hearing aides. They also had a dog that barked at 3:30am. Being up until 5 am with them was not my plan. The pool was kind of dirty also. And when we arrived there was a truck blocking the driveway also. And the air for the unit was controlled by the other guests. Which made it a stifling box of hot air with no air movement whatsoever. I emailed the property and asked for a refund as we weren’t returning and never got one.

Pool was super dirty. None of the outside stuff worked-patio fridge/ice maker. The umbrella shown in the photos wasn’t there because of previous renters, that wasn’t communicated so after we asked they dropped off one from Walmart. Patio furniture beat up, cushions for patio furniture was all ripped, stuff hanging out and needs to be replaced. No cleaning products or laundry soap on site as the listing reads. No S&P or seasonings, no garbage bags, no full size dinner plates. No mixing/salad bowls. No hot water in the main shower with the tub. No filter in fridge water. All the cheap kitchen pans, burn your food and leave a bad taste on them. The gas stove oven, doesn’t work properly (over an hr for a cheap 20 min pizza to cook and still wasn’t done) along with a terrible gas smell. We had to buy a broom just to clean a little. The kitchen sink leaks. No pool lights as shown. The beds weren’t great. The towels weren’t plush-they’re cheap. Bathrooms were dirty, no conditioner-and it does state shampoo and soap, but that’s it. Closet doors missing in rooms. I could go on and on. I’m not a rich, bougie person. I camp and don’t mind working with very little, but this place isn’t what is sold to you. It’s very cheaply put together with bare minimum, mismatched thrown together stuff, sold as something far different… I’ve stayed in a lot of places, I wouldn’t stay here again, especially for the money. Very disappointed we flew in from across the country for that. Sucks to work hard for a family vacation, have your hopes up and be so swiftly let down. 
Now, I will say, after we contacted them, they did have them come out right away and clean the pool some, and as I stated, they dropped off a Walmart umbrella. So that was nice. But there just isn’t any effort or extras and it definitely shows. They’re making bank and not putting in anything to make the stay nice for guests from out of state."

Hand prints all over the windows
Oil deposit on the stove top
Finger prints on the chairs. 
The blinds wete broken, so you are left without a view. 
The pool was disgusting. Excessive leaf deposits, bandaids, tissues in the water. Water level of the pool was very low.

Wasted a whole days worth not being able to access the pool, to a point where we tried to clean it ourselves. 
Contacted property managers only to get a response the NEXT DAY. 
Unacceptable, we wasted a days fee to clean when we should have been able to enjoy as soon as we checked in.
Do not stay here unless you want to waste money"

And pest control didn't come until a few days into our stay. Even after they came, we still had the pest issue. The overall cleanliness of this house was poor.

The room was adequate, but the bed was absolutely awful, with a very worn out mattress, zero support. The lounge area was as hard as rock and not very comfortable either. The dispensers in the bathroom were almost empty, and needed refilling. The fridge was leaking of water inside. The next morning before 8 am someone tried to enter the room (i assume to clean) why I do not know, as it is a 10am checkout so not very impressed at all. The Restaurant food was also very average. The food was overcooked especially the pasta. The 'fresh' cooked vegies were a pulpy mess , a small serve and served on a dinner plate!!

Dock is dilapidated. Kayaks were both broken down with broken seats and in poor condition. SUP was not provided. Upper deck seemed unsafe with ancient furniture. Really low class. Do not plan on cooking just not feasible in the kitchenette. Also the owners are right there every day, they never go anywhere, so there is no privacy at all.

The hot tub was awesome, and the majority of the house had modern updates. The backyard is amazing and the main reason we booked the property. But, the big problem is that the furnace only heats the bedrooms. So the main areas-kitchen, dining, living room have no heat. When we were there, it got down to the low 30's at night, and we needed heat.

Yes, the driveway is very slippery. You will need 4 wheel drive. The only two down falls were the microwave was broken and the hot tub was pretty murky. I’ve passed this house on to a few others looking for places to stay at Schweitzer that will accommodate a large group. This is it!"

The tracks in the master bedroom was so full of dirt - disgusting. The dishes were dirty had to clean them before we used them. Could not find a sharp knife anywhere.

Enjoyed that part of my stay. 
The best thing about the house was the tiki hut although the covers on the lounge chair were dry rotted and need to be replaced. One of the first things that happened was that my dog got out of the back yard because the latch on the gate was broken. Then the coffee maker didn’t work because it needed to be descaled. Three weeks in the pool turned green because it hadn’t been serviced and we couldn’t use it for a week while it cleared out. Although the house is in one level the floor isn’t level, not good for anyone with mobility issues. Then there is the pool table that takes up a third of the living space with a broken pool que.
The furniture is uncomfortable and sparse, no tables where you need them for for putting down a drink or book.
When the drainage pipe for the sinks and bathrooms backed up that was disgusting.
When the air conditioning stopped working on New Years Eve and it took 6 days for it ti be repaired in eighty degree weather it was anything but comfortable.
After a while I felt like I was there as a test Tennant to see what needed to be done to fix the home’s problems. Oh I forgot the the vent filters under the microwave look like they have never been cleaned, something is hanging down from them.
As my son told me it would be better to stay in a hotel. It would be cheaper an you have maid service and the amenities are maintained."

Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

All-in-all it was a disappointing stay."

To top this off, Evolve the property management company has double billed my credit card, so now I get to fight with them and my bank to get charges all sorted out. Again, worst experience ever on a vacation rental."

House was very nice house. Could have comfortably fit a lot more people. Nice and private up on a mountain. Super close to the lake. Great views. 

Due to the weather, we came in early and to the owners credit, was cool with it. We were arriving after a very messy previous guest, which shocked me because we always leave a place cleaner than we found it. Cleaning lady had only just gotten there. We dropped our gear, changed and left but she may have felt rushed and didn’t clean master spa and shower. Found a bunch of hair and ring around the tub. We cleaned it and give her a pass as we invaded her cleaning time.

There are really only a few suggesting I would make, but important ones. I usually share these directly with the owner and leave it off the reviews but I received no response to my feedback, so rather than risk the next person having problems, I’ll list on here.

1. No snow shovels. It snowed 3-4 feet during out stay and although there was a plow, it doesn’t get up to the vehicle. Bring one if you have one.
2. Fancy espresso machine and a keurig, but no standard coffee pot. Also, no keurig inserts. I brought grinds but ended up drinking cappuccinos the entire time when I just wanted to have my normal cup of coffee.
3. Fire place is cool but wood was not dried out and no tinder. I have been making fires for years and nothing helped. 
4 Last but not least, house is very hard to find. Not marked well."

I travel a lot, both for work and for pleasure, and have stayed at a great number of home rental properties. Both domestically and internationally, condos, and homes. After this experience, I would recommend staying clear of this particular property management company. 

My friends and I booked a large 9-bedroom 9 bathroom cabin in Big Bear, California over New Year’s Eve weekend. From the photos, the cabin looked like a dream, just a block away from the slopes of Snow Summit Mountain. There were 14 of us. All couples in our mid to late 30’s. Half of us homeowners and some of us landlords ourselves so we understand basic home maintenance. But when we arrived, we found the reality less than desirable and certainly below the standards of what was promised online.

1. PRICE: The first issue with the rental was the price. $13,395.25 for 3 nights, which included a $425 cleaning fee. We booked the cabin December 30 - January 2. We looked up the home online and found that they had hiked the price up to 3 times its normal rental rate for the holidays. Understandable that rental prices increase during these times, however, with a price as high as a 5-star luxury hotel, the following problems should not have come up. 

2. NO BASIC PAPER PRODUCTS PROVIDED: Upon arrival we became aware that we would have to buy our own toilet paper and paper towels. A bit of a basic necessity for such a steep price tag and one you would expect would be included in a nearly $4,500 a night rental. The cleaning crew did later come back to deliver some toilet paper but not until after we had gone to the store and returned with our own. They made no mention that they would be providing toilet paper when we first arrived and they were still cleaning.

3. LATE CLEANERS: Our scheduled and agreed upon check-in time was 4PM. The first members of our party arrived around 5:30 and the cleaners were still there mid clean. It would not have been that big an inconvenience had the remaining list of issues not taken place starting with the fact that the cleaners left the towels in 2 separate piles, 1 still drying in the dryer at 5:30pm, the other in a wet pile atop the dryer. Laundry should be done and put away by the time guests arrive. Not left for the guests to do.

4. LACK OF TOWELS: In a 9-bedroom house, you would expect there to be at least 2 large body towels per room, 1 for each person in a 2 person room. That would be 18 large bath towels. Plus, 1 hand towel per bathroom. It was to our dismay, after the cleaning crew left and we finished the laundry cycles ourselves, that we discovered we were short towels for each of our 14 guests. Some of us had to use hand towels to dry ourselves off after getting out of the shower, others paper towels. 

5. TRASH LEFT BEHIND: Upon checking into the rooms, we found trash left behind. In one room an Advil liquigel, in another a used disposable razor, and a third had empty shampoo bottles. Not the biggest inconvenience, but the listing specifically mentions a strict “no trash left behind” policy or we would be charged a penalty fee of $20 per bag. Also, this speaks to another example of how the the cleaning crew fell short in making a smooth transition between rentals.

6. UNSANITARY SOAP: All of the soap bottles provided in the house had been filled with mostly water creating a bubbly substance not suitable for cleaning. There was no way to properly wash our hands in any of the bathrooms and this became an unsanitary situation. Especially in a house of this size with large groups of people in the current Covid/cold season climate. And, as everyone knows, adding water to a soap can ruin the preservatives and contaminate the bottle. Bacteria may start to grow, and you could wind up with more germs on your hands than you had before you used it. We wound up having to go out and buy our own soap.

7. DEBRIS IN BATHTUB: There was a handful of debris in our bathtub. (Hair, fuzz, crumbs, etc.) It looked like the cleaners had shaken out the bathroom rugs in the tub and forgotten it there. If they had forgotten to clean the shower, we assumed they did not clean the jacuzzi tub in the rooms (which also had random hair in it – not belonging to us.) Because of this, we did not feel safe using the jacuzzi tubs and instead took showers. 

8. HOT TUB: After we experienced a few unclean areas of the home; tubs, kitchen, watered down soap, etc., we were not surprised to find the hot tub water a bit murky. A photo from the management showing the hot tub had been recently cleaned and up to standard level would have been appreciated. If the management allowed the cleaners to get away with barely cleaning the home, it was not worth the chance of getting sick from entering the hot tub. 

9. DISHWASHER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED: When we arrived, there was a full-load of dishes still in the dishwasher. The cleaning crew left us to put these away. The listing explicitly says “All dishes must be washed, dried, and put away. There is a $25.00 fee per load of dishes left dirty that the housekeepers must wash.” In addition, the top dishwasher shelf is broken and falls off the track every time you try to pull it out. It has never been cleaned and it is not apparent if it is capable of cleaning any of the dishes you put in it because the brown dirty water from the dishwasher pours out over the kitchen countertop, missing the sink entirely. 

10. OVENS NEED TO BE REPLACED: according to the listing at the time of rental, the property boasted of a brand new oven. However, not 1 but 2 ovens in this house broke on us during our stay. The inside-glass on the range shattered as we were pre-heating the oven to 400 degrees to cook a pizza. Thankfully the door was closed, and no one was near the glass when it shattered. Had any of the flying hot glass hit someone in our party, it could have resulted in medical attention. We had not used the oven prior to this pre-heat. The door on oven number 2 does not close properly leaving the hot air to escape into the kitchen.

11. DIRTY, SMELLY, STAINED BED SHEETS: The room I personally stayed in had a smell coming from the comforter that made me uncomfortable. At first, I thought maybe someone had stepped in dog feces and tracked it into the house. Upon further inspection, I discovered it was the duvet cover. It is quite disgusting to think you are sleeping in dirty sheets that a previous guest has used that were not washed properly, or perhaps not cleaned at all. Especially when there are so many other uncleanly things about the house. In addition, other rooms had sheets and duvet covers that were stained with white splotches.

12: PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME ROOM: In addition, the listing advertised a ping pong table which was not on site. Also, the air hockey table had a huge hole ripped in the center of it.

We submitted a detailed letter to management outlining every thing I have addressed in this review, to which they responded with zero effort for amends or acknowledgment of our issues.

I have never left a bad review for a property, nor have I ever received a negative review on rental sites I’ve used in the past. I understand basic wear and tear and that some things are just out of a homeowners/managers/rental properties control. However, after this experience, coupled with the price gouging and managements complete lack of understanding or acknowledgment of any kind, I would recommend everyone steer clear of this property. The posting listed by management on VRBO is dishonest.

Ultimately, we were very unhappy with our stay and would urge everyone not to stay here, unless you want the theme of your vacation to be “disappointment.”

The place was nice but the hot tub was filled with algae when we arrived and wasn’t treated for two of the four nights we were there. The management company was super responsive to my emails but correcting the issue was not as responsive. When the shower knob fell out, maintenance was out within several hours which was appreciated. 

Loved the standing desk and monitor in the master so nice of you do have to work a little while on vacation. 

Like some other vacation rentals in the area, you have to LOVE stairs as there are a LOT of them. The builder who thought a metal spiral staircase to the hot tub was clearly imbibing or enjoying from the green medical signs! No doubt they were trying to take advantage of space, but it’s a weird setup. 

I would suggest the owners put in a larger tv in the main floor as watching a football playoff game on a tiny tv was a little bit of a bummer. There is a larger one on the lower floor but not much seating. 

Minus the stairs, I think I would love this place a lot more outside of the winter skiing season. The driveway was tight with the snow but we loved seeing the bikes that could be used in non-snowing seasons."

We picked up the cabin's key around 3:55 in the office and were told that the cabin was ready by the time we arrived. We arrived at the cabin around 4 and the person who was cleaning asked for 20 more minutes.
He did not let us unload and it was super cold so we headed to the starbucks. We came back around 4:40 and the cabin was not ready yet. 
Finally he left the cabin around 5 pm and let us in after 4 hours of driving & waiting. 
After turning on the heater we felt an unpleasant smell in one of the bedrooms on the third floor.
We opened the window, closed the door, contacted the office (5:50pm). They promised to send someone to fix it, but after exchanging messages they said they cannot send anyone till the day after. 
We rented this property just because of the number of bedrooms it has so we can have our privacy. But due to this issue two of us ended up sleeping on the sofa in the living room.
Beside this issue the hot tub was super dirty. We have also found most of the sheets with stains and many pillows without covers. I wore my jacket and preferred not to use the dirty blankets and sheets. It was very disappointing.
The day after around noon we stopped by at the office to follow up (since they send no one). The person who did not let us in on check-in day was there and he acted like all the sheets were clean and he was not aware of the hot tub issue until we showed him the photo. Then he acted like he was taking notes and he would send someone to fix the problems.
Finally around 5 pm on Saturday a maintenance team member showed up and he said he cannot fix the bad odor and hot tub shortly and promised to document the issues.
During the checkout, we mentioned again about our terrible experience and they said that someone from their refund team will contact us which they never did. So we followed up a couple times and they kept saying that someone will be in contact soon. Couple days passed and no one contacted us. We finally were able to get a hold of someone and they simply refunded us $30 for the hot tub only. We spent over 2k for this property and we just got $30 back despite the fact that we couldn't use one of the rooms at all plus dirty hot tub and sheets; very disappointing. 
I would definitely not recommend this property and any other properties Managed by Meredith Logging."

My other issue is that they need to disclose that you have to buy your own propane gas as none was available and we had to buy our own, than the grill needs to be updated as it was all rotted out so we couldn’t grill outdoor. 

The guest bathroom shower had hair on the wall and the stove burners some didn’t work, assure to inspect property to assure all is available and clean mainly the bathrooms.

Unfortunately, it was largely ruined thanks to the accommodations.

My stay in Cabin #9 began with getting in after dark, and all I wanted was to make dinner and have a glass of wine. Well, the wine I picked up was warm and needed an ice cube, only to find that the refrigerator ice maker was not working and that I had to fill up 2 dirty, empty trays with water and wait for them to freeze. Not to mention the fact that the water dispenser didn't work either, and I had not purchased bottled water while at the store.

I then tried to cook a nice dinner on a relatively gross stove, only to discover that all the pans were old, super scratched Teflon pans that absolutely EVERYTHING stuck to, so I heated up canned soup, which I removed from the stove with sticky, filthy potholders.

Day 2 I tried to do some work, but the internet connection was so slow that it was impossible (download = 7.16 mbps / upload = 0.91 mbps).

Day 3 was warm enough for me to get into the hot tub, which is the reason I booked this listing. ALL I WANTED TO DO ON THIS VACATION WAS TO SOAK IN A HOT TUB, only to open it to discover a disgusting, brown, oily ring around the entire hot tub about 2 inches above the waterline. At this point, I am so frustrated that I call Vacasa support, and in their defense, a very nice gentleman almost immediately arrived to clean the hot tub. However, after wiping off the goo, he told me he shocked it and put a couple of floating sponges in it to absorb all of the oil. As you can imagine, after all of that, I was absolutely not getting into that hot tub.

In addition, there were . . . 
- ancient, hard, flat Walmart pillows
- cheap, sandpaper-like toilet paper and paper towels
- no trash bags
- broken blinds
- dirty carpet
- leather furniture with the leather worn away
- and more

I have never rented with Vrbo before. I have always used AirBNB. However, I don’t think this was Vrbo’s fault. I will simply always rent with an individual owner, not with a vacation rental management company like Vacasa."
